# Running Jobs

This page provides information on how to submit jobs to our clusters. It is intended for those familiar with scripting and job scheduling concepts.

If you have never worked on a large shared cluster, we recommend reading [What is a scheduler?](placeholder_link_to_what_is_a_scheduler) first.


All jobs must be submitted through the scheduler.  The only exceptions are for compilation and other jobs that should use less than 10 minutes of CPU time and less than 4GB of RAM. These jobs can be run on a login node. No processes should be run on a compute node without first being processed by the scheduler.

Job scheduling is done using [Slurm Workload Manager](placeholder_link_to_slurm_documentation).  The [Slurm documentation](placeholder_link_to_slurm_documentation) is maintained by SchedMD. If you are used to PBS/Torque, SGE, LSF or LoadLeveler, this [command mapping table](placeholder_link_to_command_mapping_table) will be useful.


## Submitting Jobs with `sbatch`

The `sbatch` command is used to submit a job.

```bash
$ sbatch simple_job.sh
Submitted batch job 123456
```

A simple Slurm script looks like this:

**File: `simple_job.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --time=00:15:00
#SBATCH --account=def-someuser
echo 'Hello, world!'
sleep 30
```

On general-purpose supercomputers, this job reserves one (1) core and 256MB of memory for 15 minutes. On Niagara, the job reserves the entire node with all its memory.

Directives (or options) within the script are prefixed with `#SBATCH` and must precede all executable commands. The [sbatch page](placeholder_link_to_sbatch_page) describes all available directives. For each job, our policy requires providing at least a duration (`--time`) and an account name (`--account`); see the Accounts and Projects section below.

Directives can also be command-line arguments to `sbatch`. For example,

```bash
$ sbatch --time=00:30:00 simple_job.sh
```

submits the above script, limiting the duration to 30 minutes. Valid time formats are minutes, minutes:seconds, hours:minutes:seconds, days-hours, days-hours:minutes, days-hours:minutes:seconds. Be aware that the duration significantly impacts the waiting time before the job is executed. Long-running jobs are likely to run on fewer nodes.

Running a script that submits multiple jobs at short intervals may affect the availability of the Slurm scheduler for other users (see information on the error message `Batch job submission failed: Socket timed out on send/recv operation`). Instead, use a job array or space out `sbatch` calls by one second or more using the `sleep` command.


### Memory

The amount of memory can be requested with `--mem-per-cpu` (memory per core) or `--mem` (memory per node). On general-purpose clusters, 256MB per core is allocated by default. On Niagara, it is not necessary to specify the amount of memory because only entire nodes are allocated with all available memory.

A common source of confusion is that some amount of node memory is unavailable to the job, reserved for the operating system, etc. Each node type therefore has a maximum amount available to submitted jobs; for example, 128GB nodes are configured to offer 125GB for the execution of submitted jobs. If you request more than this amount, your job will have to run on larger memory nodes, which may be less numerous.

To further complicate matters, K, M, G, etc. are interpreted by Slurm as binary prefixes; thus `--mem=125G` is equivalent to `--mem=128000M`. The amount of memory you can request is indicated in the [Node Characteristics](placeholder_link_to_node_characteristics) table for Beluga, Cedar, Graham, and Narval.


## Listing Jobs with `squeue` or `sq`

The command used to check the status of Slurm jobs is `squeue`; by default, it provides information on all jobs. The short form `sq` will only list your own jobs.

```bash
$ sq
JOBID   USER       ACCOUNT      NAME       ST  TIME_LEFT  NODES  CPUS  GRES    MIN_MEM NODELIST  (REASON)
123456  smithj     def-smithj   simple_j   R   0:03       1      1    (null)   4G       cdr234   (None)
123457  smithj     def-smithj   bigger_j   PD  2         -00:00:00 1      16   (null)   16G      (Priority)
```

In the output, the ST column shows the status of each job. The most common states are PD (pending) for waiting, and R (running) for running.

For more information on the output provided by `sq` and `squeue`, and how to modify the output, consult the [documentation for squeue](placeholder_link_to_squeue_documentation). `sq` is a command created for our environments.

Do not repeatedly execute `squeue` or `sq` commands at short intervals from a script or application. This overloads Slurm and is very likely to impair its performance or proper functioning. To know when a job starts and ends, see Getting email notifications below.


## Saving the Output

By default, the output is written to a file whose name starts with `slurm-`, followed by the job ID and the suffix `.out`, for example `slurm-123456.out`. The presence of the ID in the file name is convenient for debugging. The file is placed in the directory from which the job was submitted.

If you need to specify a different location or name, use the `--output` command. The file name can contain certain replacement symbols, such as the job ID, job name, or job array ID. See the [sbatch page](placeholder_link_to_sbatch_page) for the complete list.

Errors normally appear in the same file as the standard output, just as if the commands were given interactively. To direct the standard error stream (stderr for standard error) to another file, use `--error`.


## Accounts and Projects

Each job must be associated with an account name corresponding to a RAP (Resource Allocation Project). If you are a member of only one account, the scheduler automatically associates your jobs with that account.

If you receive one of the following messages when submitting a job, you have access to more than one account:

```
You are associated with multiple _cpu allocations...
Please specify one of the following accounts to submit this job:
You are associated with multiple _gpu allocations...
Please specify one of the following accounts to submit this job:
```

In this case, use the `--account` directive to specify one of the accounts listed in the error message, for example `#SBATCH --account=def-user-ab`.

To find the account name corresponding to a project, log in to [CCDB](placeholder_link_to_ccdb) and click on *My Account -> My Resources and Allocations* to display the list of projects you are a member of. The second field (*Group Name*) contains the string to use with the `--account` directive. Note that a project that has received a resource allocation may be associated with a particular cluster (or group of clusters) and may not be transferable from one cluster to another.  In the following example, jobs submitted by `--account=def-fuenma` will be assigned to zhf-914-aa.


### How to find the group name for a Resource Allocation Project (RAP)

If you plan to always use the same account for all jobs, you will find it useful to define the following environment variables in your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export SLURM_ACCOUNT=def-someuser
export SBATCH_ACCOUNT=$SLURM_ACCOUNT
export SALLOC_ACCOUNT=$SLURM_ACCOUNT
```

Slurm will use the value of `SBATCH_ACCOUNT` in the script rather than the `--account` directive. Even if you specify an account name in the script, the environment variable takes precedence. To override the environment variable, an account name must be provided as a command-line argument with `sbatch`.

`SLURM_ACCOUNT` plays the same role as `SBATCH_ACCOUNT`, but for the `srun` command rather than `sbatch`. The same is true for `SALLOC_ACCOUNT`.


## Examples of Scripts

### Sequential Jobs

A sequential job is a job that requires only one core. This is the simplest type of job, an example of which is found above in the Submitting Jobs with `sbatch` section.


### Batch Jobs (Job Arrays)

A batch job (task array or array job) is used to submit a set of jobs using a single command. Each job in the batch is distinguished by the environment variable `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`, which has a distinct value for each instance of the job. The following example creates 10 jobs with `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID` having values from 1 to 10:

**File: `array_job.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=def-someuser
#SBATCH --time=0-0:5
#SBATCH --array=1-10
./myapplication $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
```

See other examples on the [Job Arrays](placeholder_link_to_job_arrays) page and the detailed [Slurm documentation from SchedMD.com](placeholder_link_to_slurm_documentation).


### Multithreaded Job or OpenMP Job

The next example involves a single process and eight CPU cores. Remember that to use OpenMP, an application must have been compiled with the appropriate flags, either `gcc -fopenmp ...` or `icc -openmp ...`.

**File: `openmp_job.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=def-someuser
#SBATCH --time=0-0:5
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
./ompHello
```


### MPI Job

The next script launches four MPI processes, each requiring 1024MB of memory. The execution time is limited to five minutes.

**File: `mpi_job.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=def-someuser
#SBATCH --ntasks=4               # number of MPI processes
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1024M      # memory (default in megabytes)
#SBATCH --time=0-00:05           # time limit (DD-HH:MM)
srun ./mpi_program
# mpirun and mpiexec also work
```

MPI-intensive jobs, and specifically those that can efficiently use entire nodes, should use `--nodes` and `--ntasks-per-node` instead of `--ntasks`. It is also possible to have hybrid jobs that are both MPI and multithreaded. For more information on distributed parallel jobs, see [Controlling Scheduling with MPI](placeholder_link_to_controlling_scheduling_with_mpi).

For more information, see the [OpenMP](placeholder_link_to_openmp) page.


### GPU Job (with Graphics Processing Unit)

To use a GPU, several options must be considered, especially because the Cedar and Graham nodes equipped with GPUs are not all configured uniformly, there are two different configurations on Cedar, the policies are different for Cedar GPU nodes. For information and examples of scheduling on GPU resources, see [Slurm Scheduling of Jobs with GPUs](placeholder_link_to_slurm_scheduling_of_jobs_with_gpus).


## Interactive Jobs

While batch job submission is the most efficient way to use Compute Canada clusters, it is possible to submit jobs interactively. This can be useful for:

*   Exploring data in command-line mode
*   Using interactive console tools from R and iPython
*   Intensive development, debugging, or compilation projects

To start an interactive session on a compute node, use `salloc`. In the following example, we have a job on one CPU core and 3GB of memory, for a duration of one hour.

```bash
$ salloc --time=1:0:0 --mem-per-cpu=3G --ntasks=1 --account=def-someuser
salloc: Granted job allocation 1234567
$ ...             # do some work
$ exit            # terminate the allocation
salloc: Relinquishing job allocation 1234567
```

It is also possible to run graphical applications in interactive mode on a compute node by adding the `--x11` flag to the `salloc` command. To do this, you must first enable X11 forwarding; see the [SSH](placeholder_link_to_ssh) page. Note that an interactive job lasting less than three (3) hours is likely to be launched shortly after submission since we have dedicated test nodes to them. Jobs longer than three (3) hours are run on regular cluster nodes and may be pending for several hours or even several days before being launched at an unpredictable and possibly inconvenient time.


## Job Monitoring

### Jobs in Progress

By default, `squeue` shows all jobs currently managed by the scheduler. The result will be faster if you only request your own jobs with:

```bash
$ squeue -u $USER
```

You can also use the short form `sq`.

To find out about running or pending jobs, use:

```bash
$ squeue -u <username> -t RUNNING
$ squeue -u <username> -t PENDING
```

To find out the details of a particular job, use `scontrol`:

```bash
$ scontrol show job <jobid>
```

Do not repeatedly execute the `squeue` command at short intervals from a script or application. This command overloads Slurm and is very likely to impair its performance or proper functioning.


#### Getting Email Notifications

To receive email notifications about a job, use the various options with:

```bash
#SBATCH --mail-user=your.email@example.com
#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
```

Use these options only if you intend to read all the messages that will be generated. Our service providers (Google, Yahoo, etc.) may limit the number of emails from our domains because too many messages are generated.

For the list of options for `--mail-type`, see the [SchedMD documentation](placeholder_link_to_schedmd_documentation).


#### Buffered Output

Normally, the output of a non-interactive job is buffered, meaning there is usually a delay between the time the job data is written and the time you can see the results on a login node. This delay depends on the application you are using and the load on the file system; it can vary from less than a second to until the job ends.

There are ways to reduce or even eliminate this delay, but they are not recommended because using buffering ensures the overall good performance of the file system. If you need to monitor the results of a job in real time, use an interactive job instead, as described above.


### Completed Jobs

The `seff` command provides a summary of CPU and memory efficiency for a completed job.

```bash
$ seff 12345678
Job ID: 12345678
Cluster: cedar
User/Group: jsmith/jsmith
State: COMPLETED (exit code 0)
Cores: 1
CPU Utilized: 02:48:58
CPU Efficiency: 99.72% of 02:49:26 core-walltime
Job Wall-clock time: 02:49:26
Memory Utilized: 213.85 MB
Memory Efficiency: 0.17% of 125.00 GB
```

For more information on a completed job, use `sacct`; add `--format` to find out the result of the job, such as:

```bash
$ sacct -j <jobid>
$ sacct -j <jobid> --format=JobID,JobName,MaxRSS,Elapsed
```

The output of `sacct` generally includes `.bat+` and `.ext+` records, and possibly also `.0`, `.1`, `.2`, ...

The batch step (`.bat+`) is your submission script; for multiple jobs, this is where most of the work is done and resources are consumed. If you use `srun` in your submission script, a `.0` step would be created, consuming almost all resources. The external step (`.ext+`) is mainly in prologue and epilogue and usually does not consume a large amount of resources. If a node fails during job execution, the job can be restarted. `sacct` normally shows the last record for the last (presumably successful) execution. To see all records related to a job, add the `--duplicates` option.

The MaxRSS field gives the amount of memory used by a job; it returns the value of the largest resident set size. To know the job and node involved, also print the MaxRSSTask and MaxRSSNode fields.  The `sstat` command provides information on the status of a running job; the `sacct` command is used for jobs that are finished.


#### Monitoring a Running Job

It is possible to connect to a node on which a job is running and run new processes there. This is particularly useful for troubleshooting or monitoring the progress of a job.

The `nvidia-smi` utility is used to monitor GPU usage on a node where a job is running. The following example runs `watch` on the node which in turn launches `nvidia-smi` every 30 seconds and displays the result on the terminal.

```bash
$ srun --jobid 123456 --pty watch -n 30 nvidia-smi
```

Several monitoring commands can be launched with `tmux`. The following example runs `htop` and `nvidia-smi` in separate windows to monitor activity on the node where the job is running.

```bash
$ srun --jobid 123456 --pty tmux new-session -d 'htop -u $USER' \; split-window -h 'watch nvidia-smi' \; attach
```

Processes launched with `srun` share the resources used by the job in question. Therefore, avoid launching processes that would use resources to the detriment of the job. In cases where processes use too many resources, the job may be stopped; using too many CPU cycles slows down a job.

**Note:** In the previous examples, `srun` only works on jobs submitted with `sbatch`. To monitor an interactive job, open multiple windows with `tmux` and start the processes in separate windows.


## Cancelling a Job

To cancel a job, specify its ID as follows:

```bash
$ scancel <jobid>
```

Cancel all your jobs or only your pending jobs as follows:

```bash
$ scancel -u $USER
$ scancel -t PENDING -u $USER
```


## Resubmitting a Job for a Long Calculation

For calculations requiring a longer duration than the system's time limit, the application must be able to handle checkpointing. It must also allow saving its entire state to a checkpoint file and be able to restart and continue the calculation from the last state.

Many users will have few occasions to restart a calculation, and this can be done manually. In some cases, however, frequent restarts are required and some form of automation can be applied. The two recommended methods are:

*   Using Slurm job arrays
*   Resubmission from the end of the script

See information on [chunking a long job](placeholder_link_to_chunking_a_long_job_tutorial) in our [machine learning tutorial](placeholder_link_to_machine_learning_tutorial).


### Restarting with Job Arrays

The syntax `--array=1-100%10` allows submitting a collection of identical jobs by running only one job at a time. The script must ensure that the last checkpoint is always used for the next job. The number of restarts is specified with the `--array` argument.

In the following molecular dynamics example, the simulation involves 1 million steps and exceeds the time limit imposed on the cluster. However, the simulation can be divided into 10 jobs of 100,000 sequential steps.


**Restarting a simulation with a job array:**

**File: `job_array_restart.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Slurm script for a multi-step job
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#SBATCH --account=def-someuser
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --time=0-10:00
#SBATCH --mem=100M
#SBATCH --array=1-10%1   # run an array of 10 jobs, one at a time
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
echo "Current working directory: `pwd`"
echo "Starting run at: `date`"
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
echo ""
echo "Job Array ID / Job ID: $SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID / $SLURM_JOB_ID"
echo "This is job $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID out of $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_COUNT jobs."
echo ""
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# run the simulation step here...
if test -e state.cpt; then
    # there is a checkpoint, restart
    mdrun --restart state.cpt
else
    # there is no checkpoint, start a new simulation
    mdrun
fi
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
echo "Job finished with exit code $? at: `date`"
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
```


### Resubmitting from a Script

In the next example, the job runs the first part of the calculation and saves a checkpoint. When the first part is finished, but before the execution time allocated to the job has expired, the script checks if the calculation is finished. If the calculation is not finished, the script submits a copy of itself and continues the work.


**Resubmission with a script:**

**File: `job_resubmission.sh`**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Slurm script to resubmit a job
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#SBATCH --job-name=job_chain
#SBATCH --account=def-someuser
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --time=0-10:00
#SBATCH --mem=100M
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
echo "Current working directory: `pwd`"
echo "Starting run at: `date`"
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# run the simulation step here...
if test -e state.cpt; then
    # there is a checkpoint, restart
    mdrun --restart state.cpt
else
    # there is no checkpoint, start a new simulation
    mdrun
fi
# resubmit if the work is not yet finished
# define the work_should_continue() function
if work_should_continue; then
    sbatch ${BASH_SOURCE[0]}
fi
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
echo "Job finished with exit code $? at: `date`"
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
```

**Remark:** The test used to determine whether to submit a second job (`work_should_continue` in our example) must be a positive test. You might be tempted to check for the existence of a stop condition (e.g., meeting a convergence criterion) and submit a second job if the condition is not detected. However, if an unexpected error occurs, the stop condition might not be detected and the job sequence would continue indefinitely.


## Automating Job Submission

As mentioned earlier, job arrays can be used to automate job submission. We offer a few other more advanced tools for running a large number of sequential, parallel, or GPU-using jobs. These tools apply a technique called farming, serial farming, or task farming, which translates to server cluster and sometimes server farm or compute farm. In addition to automating the workflow, these tools improve processing efficiency by grouping several small computation jobs to create fewer jobs, but with longer durations.

The following tools are available on our clusters:

*   META-Farm
*   GNU Parallel
*   GLOST


## Not Specifying a Partition

With some software packages like Masurca, jobs are submitted to Slurm automatically, and the software expects a partition to be specified for each job. This is contrary to our best practices, which want the scheduler to assign jobs itself, according to the required resources. If you use such software, you can configure it to use `--partition=default` so that the script interprets it as if no partition is specified.


## Specificities of Certain Clusters

Scheduling policies are not the same on all our clusters.

*   **Beluga:** The maximum duration of a job is 168 hours (7 days) and the maximum number of jobs running or pending in the queue is 1000 per user. The duration of a production job should be at least one hour.
*   **Cedar:** Jobs cannot be run from directories in the `/home` file system; this is to reduce the load and improve interactive response time. The maximum duration of a job is 28 days. If the command `readlink -f $(pwd) | cut -d/ -f2` returns the message `you are not permitted to submit jobs from that directory`, transfer the files to a `/project` or `/scratch` directory and submit the job from the new location.
*   **Graham:** The maximum duration of a job is 168 hours (7 days) and the maximum number of jobs running or pending in the queue is 1000 per user. The duration of a production job should be at least one hour.
*   **Narval:** The maximum duration of a job is 168 hours (7 days) and the maximum number of jobs running or pending in the queue is 1000 per user. The duration of a production job should be at least one hour.
*   **Niagara:** Scheduling is done per node, so in multiples of 40 cores. The maximum execution time of a job is 24 hours. Writing must be done in the `scratch` or `project` directories (on compute nodes, `home` is read-only). Compute nodes do not have internet access. Move your data to Niagara before submitting your job.


## Troubleshooting

### Avoiding Hidden Characters

Using word processing software instead of a text editor can cause problems with your scripts. When working on the cluster directly, it is preferable to use an editor like nano, vim, or emacs. If you prepare your scripts offline,

*   **Under Windows:** Use a text editor like Notepad or Notepad++, upload the script and change the Windows end-of-line codes to Linux end-of-line codes with `dos2unix`
*   **Under Mac:** In a terminal window, use an editor like nano, vim, or emacs


### Cancellation of Jobs Whose Dependency Conditions Are Not Met

A dependent job submitted with `--dependency=afterok:<jobid>` waits for the parent job to finish before executing. If the parent job stops before it ends (i.e., it produces a non-zero exit code), the dependent job will never execute and is automatically cancelled. For more information on dependency, see `sbatch`.


### Module Not Loaded by a Job

The following error may occur if a condition is not met:

```
Lmod has detected the following error: These module(s) exist but cannot be
loaded as requested: "<module-name>/<version>"
Try: "module spider <module-name>/<version>" to see how to load the module(s).
```

For example:

```bash
$ module load gcc
$ module load quantumespresso/6.1
Lmod has detected the following error:  These module(s) exist but cannot be loaded as requested: "quantumespresso/6.1"
Try: "module spider quantumespresso/6.1" to see how to load the module(s).
$ module spider quantumespresso/6.1

To solve this problem, add the line `module load nixpkgs/16.09 intel/2016.4 openmpi/2.1.1` to the script before loading `quantumespresso/6.1`.


### Propagation of Environment Variables

By default, a job inherits the environment variables from the shell from which it was launched. The module loading command modifies and configures the environment variables, which are then propagated to the jobs submitted from the shell. A job may therefore be unable to load modules if all conditions are not met. It is therefore recommended to add the line `module purge` to the script before loading the modules you need to ensure that jobs are submitted uniformly and are not affected by modifications made in the shell.

Problems are sometimes difficult to diagnose when environment parameters are inherited from the shell that submits the job; the `--export=none` directive prevents this type of inheritance.


### Job Freezes / No Output / Incomplete Output

Sometimes no output (or only part of it) is recorded in the `.out` file for a submitted job, and it seems to be stopped. This mainly happens because the buffering performed by the Slurm scheduler is aggressive, as it groups several lines of output before routing them to the file, and often this file is only produced when the job ends. Worse, if a job is cancelled or runs out of time, some of the results may be lost. If you want to follow the progress of the running job as it executes, you can do so with an interactive job. This is also a good way to observe how long the job needs.


## Job Status and Priority

Consult [Job Scheduling Policy](placeholder_link_to_job_scheduling_policy) for information on the job prioritization policy on Cedar and Graham and to find out the elements that may influence the scheduling of your jobs. If jobs in your research group are competing with each other, see [Managing Slurm Accounts](placeholder_link_to_managing_slurm_accounts).
