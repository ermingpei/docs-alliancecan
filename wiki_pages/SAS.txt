SAS is a statistical analysis suite developed by the [https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html SAS Institute]. SAS is commercial software so users must supply their own license to run this software on Compute Canada clusters. Due to licensing restrictions, the software must be installed locally, in a user's personal directory, rather than centrally. Given the constraints of a cluster environment, it is recommended that users restrict themselves to the use of SAS in a command line environment by means of the option <code>-nodms</code>.
