<!--T:1-->
The Globus file transfer tool which we use on our servers is evolving.  On December 18, 2023, Globus Connect Server version 4 (GCSv4) has reached its end of life.  You may need to take action <b>if you own a shared collection</b> (previously named <b>shared endpoint</b> in Globus version 4).

<!--T:2-->
You may have received a message from Globus containing the following information: 
{{Warning|title=Message sent by Globus|content=
: <i>GCS Version 4 will be discontinued on December 18, 2023. If you have not yet migrated your Globus Connect Server v4 deployment or updated your applications to support Globus Connect Server v5, we urge you to do so now.</i><br>
The original announcement was made in July 2023: https://www.globus.org/blog/globus-connect-server-v4-will-be-deprecated-july-31-2023.}}

= What do I need to do? = <!--T:3-->

<!--T:4-->
What you need to do depends on where your shared collection (formerly <i>shared endpoint</i>) is located.

== Cedar == <!--T:5-->
At Cedar, the endpoint <code>computecanada#cedar-dtn</code> used version 4 of Globus and has been discontinued on December 15, 2023. Before this date, users needed to recreate their shared collections using the endpoint <code>computecanada#cedar-globus</code>, which uses version 5. 

== Béluga == <!--T:6-->
At Béluga, the existing Globus v4 endpoint has been upgraded to Globus v5 during the scheduled maintenance on November 28, 2023. Most shared collections, which used the Compute Canada identity provider, has been migrated automatically. However, if a collection was created using a third party identity provider, it must be re-created after November 28, 2023.

== Graham and Narval == <!--T:7-->
Their respective endpoints already use version 5.  No further action is required.

== Niagara == <!--T:8-->
The Niagara endpoint already uses version 5. No action is required from users since Globus shared collections are not allowed at Niagara.

= How to share data with Globus version 5 = <!--T:9-->
Instructions for sharing data using Globus version 5 can be found [[Globus#Globus_sharing|here]].

= Timeline = <!--T:10-->
* November 28, 2023:  End of GCSv4 at Béluga
* December 15, 2023:  End of GCSv4 at Cedar
* December 18, 2023:  End of GCSv4 everywhere
