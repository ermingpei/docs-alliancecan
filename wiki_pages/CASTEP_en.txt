==Installing CASTEP==
For example, with version <code>20.11</code>:
# You must [http://www.castep.org/get_castep '''get the archive file that contains the installer''']; this file should be named <code>CASTEP-20.11.tar.gz</code>.
# Upload the <code>CASTEP-20.11.tar.gz</code> file to your <code>/home/$USER</code> folder on the cluster you intend to use.
# On the cluster, run the command:
 [name@server ~]$ eb CASTEP-20.11-iofbf-2020a.eb --sourcepath=$HOME --disable-enforce-checksums
Once this command has completed, log out from the cluster and log back in.

==Using CASTEP==
You should be able to load the module with:
 [name@server ~]$ module load castep
On a compute node, the CASTEP executable can be used like an [[Running_jobs#MPI_job|MPI application]]:
 [name@server ~]$ srun castep.mpi seedname
Where input files would be <code>seedname.cell</code> and <code>seedname.param</code> (i.e. "seedname" could be a different name).
