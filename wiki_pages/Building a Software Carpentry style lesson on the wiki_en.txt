It may be interesting to use our wiki to host Software Carpentry-style lessons. Software Carpentry lessons, such as [http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/ this one], are usually hosted on Github. They can be written with a Markdown syntax, and provide many pre-formatted styles. Hosting a lesson on a wiki also offers the advantage of supporting translation. In order to facilitate the writing of such lesson, a few templates may be useful, and are listed below. 
== Prerequisites == <!--T:2-->
The typical SWC prerequisites box can be obtained using the [[Template:Prerequisites|<nowiki>{{Prerequisites}}</nowiki>]] template. For example, the following code
<syntaxhighlight>
{{Prerequisites
  |title=Prerequisites for this lesson
  |content=
This lesson requires you to first know X.
}}
</syntaxhighlight>
results in the following box
{{Prerequisites
  |title=Prerequisites for this lesson
  |content=
This lesson requires you to first know X.
}}

== Getting ready == <!--T:3-->
The SWC "getting ready" box can be obtained using the [[Template:Getready|<nowiki>{{Getready}}</nowiki>]] template. For example, the following code

You should download the following files prior to starting the lesson.

== Learning Objectives == <!--T:4-->
