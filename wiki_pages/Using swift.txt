== Object Storage in Arbutus cloud ==

The OpenStack Object Store project, known as Swift, offers cloud storage software so that you can store and retrieve lots of data with a simple API.

If you require s3 access to it, please contact our [[Technical support]].

== Using the Object Storage via Browser ==

Swift can be accessed via the openstack cli and/or via the [https://arbutus.cloud.computecanada.ca Cloud webinterface].

the container becomes public and will be accessible by anyone. If the container has no public access, it can only be used within the projects VMs.
