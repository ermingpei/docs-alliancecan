<b>Killarney</b> is a cluster dedicated to the needs of the Canadian scientific Artificial Intelligence community. <b>Killarney</b> is located at the [https://www.utoronto.ca/ University of Toronto] and is managed by the [https://vectorinstitute.ai/ Vector Institute]  and [https://www.scinethpc.ca/ SciNet]. It is named after the [https://www.ontarioparks.ca/park/killarney Killarney Ontario Provincial Park], located near Georgian Bay.

<!--T:3-->
This cluster is part of the Pan-Canadian AI Compute Environment (PAICE).

==Storage System== <!--T:6-->

<!--T:7-->
<b>Killarney</b>'s storage system is an all-NVME VastData platform with a total usable capacity of 1.7PB.

<!--T:8-->
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
| <b>Home space</b><br /> 1.7 TB total volume||
* Location of /home directories.
* Each /home directory has a small fixed [[Storage and file management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies|quota]].
* Not allocated via [https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/accessing-resources/rapid-access-service RAS] or [https://alliancecan.ca/en/services/advanced-research-computing/accessing-resources/resource-allocation-competition RAC]. Larger requests go to the /project space.
* Has daily backup
|-
| <b>Scratch space</b><br /> 1.7 PB total volume<br />Parallel high-performance filesystem ||
* For active or temporary (scratch) storage.
* Not allocated.
* Large fixed [[Storage and file management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies|quota]] per user.
* Inactive data will be [[Scratch purging policy|purged]].
|-
|<b>Project space</b><br />1.7 PB total volume<br />External persistent storage
||
* Large adjustable [[Storage and file management#Filesystem_quotas_and_policies|quota]] per project.
* Has daily backup.

==Network Interconnects== <!--T:9-->

<!--T:10-->
Standard Compute nodes are interconnected with Infiniband HDR100 for 100Gbps throughput, while Performance Compute nodes are connected with 2 x HDR 200 for 400Gbps aggregate throughput.

==Scheduling== <!--T:11-->
The <b>Killarney</b> cluster uses the Slurm scheduler to run user workloads. The basic scheduling commands are similar to the other national systems.

==Software== <!--T:12-->
* Module-based software stack.
* Both the standard Alliance software stack as well as cluster-specific software.
