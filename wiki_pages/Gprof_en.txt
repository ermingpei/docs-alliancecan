== What is gprof? ==
[https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/ gprof] is a profiling software which collects information and compiles statistics on your code. Generally, it searches for functions and subroutines in your program and inserts timing instructions for each one. Executing such a modified program creates a raw data file which can be interpreted by gprof and turned into profiling statistics.

[https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/ gprof] comes with the GNU compiler suite and is available with the <tt>gcc</tt> module on our clusters.

== Preparing your application ==
=== Loading the GNU compiler ===
Load the appropriate GNU compiler. For example, for GCC:
{{Command|module load gcc/7.3.0}}

=== Compiling your code ===
To get useful information from [https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/gprof/ gprof], you first need to compile your code with debugging information enabled. With the GNU compilers, you do so by adding the <tt>-pg</tt> option to the compilation command. This option tells the compiler to generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis. Without this option, no call-graph data will be gathered and you may get the following error:
<pre>
gprof: gmon.out file is missing call-graph data
</pre>
=== Executing your code ===
Once your code has been compiled with the proper options, you then execute it:
{{Command|/path/to/your/executable arg1 arg2}}
You should run your code the same way as you would without gprof profiling; the execution line does not change.
Once the binary has been executed and finished without any errors, a new file <tt>gmon.out</tt> is created in the current working directory. Note that if your code changes the current directory, <tt>gmon.out</tt> will be created in the new working directory, insofar as your program has sufficient permissions to do so. 

=== Getting the profiling data ===
In this step the gprof tool is executed with the binary name and the above mentioned <tt>gmon.out</tt> as argument; the analysis file is created with all the desired profiling information.

{{Command|gprof /path/to/your/executable gmon.out > analysis.txt}}
