[https://github.com/Syllo/nvtop NVTOP] stands for Neat Videocard TOP, a (h)top like task monitor for GPUs and accelerators. It can handle multiple GPUs and print information about them in a htop-familiar way.

__FORCETOC__

= Monitor GPUs usage = <!--T:4-->
NVTOP can monitor single or multiple GPUs. It can show the GPU usage and its memory.
One can also select a specific device from the menu (F2 -> GPU Select).

<!--T:5-->
NVTOP is useful to monitor and verify that your job is using the GPU as efficiently as possible.

== Monitor batch job == <!--T:6-->
If you have submitted a non-interactive job and would like to see its current GPU usage.

<!--T:7-->
1. From a login node, find the job id and select the one to monitor:
{{Command|sq}}

<!--T:8-->
2. Attach to the running job:
{{Command|srun --pty --jobid JOBID nvtop}}

== Monitor interactive job == <!--T:9-->
1. Start your interactive job with minimal resources.

<!--T:10-->
2. In a second terminal, connect to the login node, find the job id:
{{Command|sq}}

<!--T:11-->
3. Attach to the running job:
{{Command|srun --pty --jobid JOBID nvtop}}

<!--T:12-->
You'll be able to see the usage in real time as you run your commands in the first terminal.

== Monitor a GPU on a specific node == <!--T:13-->
When running multi-nodes jobs, it can be useful to verify that one or all GPUs are effectively used.

<!--T:14-->
1. From a login node, find the job id and identify the node names:
{{Commands
|sq
|srun --jobid JOBID -n1 -c1 scontrol show hostname
}}

<!--T:15-->
2. Attach to the running job on the specific node:
{{Command|srun --pty --jobid JOBiD --nodelist NODENAME nvtop}}
