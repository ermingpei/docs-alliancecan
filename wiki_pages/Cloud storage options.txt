<!--T:1-->
The existing storage types available in our clouds are:

<!--T:2-->
* <b>[[Working_with_volumes | Volume storage]]</b>: The standard storage unit for cloud computing; can be attached to and detached from an instance. 
* <b>Ephemeral/Disk storage</b>: Virtual local disk storage tied to the lifecycle of a single instance on a hypervisor's local disk ("c" flavor local disk can be lost)
* <b>[[Arbutus object storage | Object storage]]</b>:  Non-hierarchical storage where data is created or uploaded in whole-file form.
* <b>[[Arbutus_CephFS | Shared filesystem storage]]</b>: Private network attached storage space (similar to NFS/SMB shares); must be configured on each instance where it is mounted.

<!--T:3-->
Attributes of each storage type are compared in the following table:
