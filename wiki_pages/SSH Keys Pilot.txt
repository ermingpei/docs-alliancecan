<!--T:1-->
In our continuous efforts to secure our national infrastructure, we have implemented a new feature in the CCDB whereby public SSH keys can be uploaded to your account and used to connect to our clusters ([[Cedar]], [[Graham]], [[Béluga/en|Béluga]], and [[Niagara |Niagara and Mist]]). 

<!--T:2-->
We evaluated the possibility of enforcing authentication with SSH keys to access all of our clusters and conducted a pilot project on Niagara and Mist. Having received positive feedback from the community, SSH keys will become the only way to authenticate on '''Niagara and Mist''' starting on January 24, 2022.

== What you need to do == <!--T:7-->

<!--T:8-->
To learn about SSH keys, see the drop-in sessions on https://support.scinet.utoronto.ca/education/go.php/586/index.php/ib/1//p_course/586.

'''If you know how to use SSH keys''', 
# Create your SSH key pair from your workstation.
# Upload your SSH public key to your CCDB account by connecting to https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/ssh_authorized_keys. After a few minutes, you should be able to authenticate on Niagara or Mist.
# If the <tt>.ssh</tt> folder in your <tt>$HOME</tt> directory contains a file named <tt>authorized_keys</tt>, it should be deleted.
# Log out of the cluster and log in again.
