'''Mp2 is now exclusive to researchers from the Université de Sherbrooke.'''

Mammouth-Mp2 is a heterogeneous and polyvalent cluster designed for ordinary computations; it is located at the [http://www.usherbrooke.ca/ Université de Sherbrooke].

=Site-specific policies=

*Each job must have a duration of at least one hour (at least five minutes for test jobs) and a user cannot have more than 1000 jobs (running and queued) at any given time. The maximum duration of a job is 168 hours (seven days).

*No GPUs.

=Storage=

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
| HOME <br> Lustre filesystem <br> 79.6 TB of space in total || 
*This space is small and cannot be expanded; you should use your <code>project</code> space for substantial storage needs.

*50 GB  of space and 500K files per user.

*There is a daily backup.
|-
| SCRATCH <br> Lustre filesystem <br> 358.3 TB  of space in total ||

*Large space for storing temporary files during computations.

*20 TB of space and 1M files per user. 

* No backup system in place. 

|-
| PROJECT <br> Lustre filesystem <br> 716.6 TB of space in total ||

*This space is designed for sharing data among the members of a research group and for storing large amounts of data. 

*1 TB  of space and 500K files per group. 

* No backup system in place.

For transferring data by Globus, you should use the endpoint <code>computecanada#mammouth</code>, whereas tools like rsync and scp can simply use an ordinary login node.

=High-performance interconnect=

The Mellanox QDR (40 Gb/s) Infiniband network links together all of the cluster's nodes and is non-blocking for groups of 216 nodes and 5:1 for the rest of the cluster.
