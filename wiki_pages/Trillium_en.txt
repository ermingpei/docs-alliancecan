Trillium is a large parallel cluster built by Lenovo Canada and hosted by SciNet at the University of Toronto.

=Installation and transition=
Due to limits on available power and cooling capacity there will be an interim period in which a significant portion of the old Niagara will be shut down in order to provide power for the new system's acceptance testing and transition. We'll update you when we have a better idea of Trillium's installation schedule.

=Storage=
Parallel storage: 29 petabytes, NVMe SSD based storage from VAST Data.

=High-performance network=
* Nvidia “NDR” Infiniband network
** 400 Gbit/s network bandwidth for CPU nodes
** 800 Gbit/s network bandwidth for GPU nodes
** Fully non-blocking, meaning every node can talk to every other node at full bandwidth simultaneously.
