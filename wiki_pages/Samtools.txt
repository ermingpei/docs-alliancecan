== Description ==
Samtools is a suite of programs for interacting with high-throughput sequencing data.
It is closely related to BCFtools and to HTSlib.  Primary documentation for all three
of these packages can be found at https://www.htslib.org/

<!--T:4-->
* Samtools is for reading, writing, editing, indexing, and viewing files in SAM, BAM, or CRAM format
* BCFtools is for reading and writing files in BCF2, VCF, and gVCF format, and for calling, filtering, and summarizing SNP and short indel sequence variants
* HTSlib is a C-language library for reading and writing high-throughput sequencing data.  It is used by both Samtools and BCFtools.  

<!--T:6-->
This page does not cover all features of Samtools.  Please refer to [http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html Samtools] for the complete list of all subtools.

<!--T:11-->
To load the default version of samtools use <code>module load samtools</code>, e.g.:

</translate>
{{Commands
|module load samtools
|samtools

Program: samtools (Tools for alignments in the SAM format)
Version: 1.20 (using htslib 1.20)

Usage:   samtools <command> [options]}}
<translate>

<!--T:45-->
For more on the <code>module</code> command, including how to find other versions of samtools, see [[Utiliser_des_modules/en|Using modules]]

== General usage == <!--T:46-->

<!--T:14-->
SAMtools provides tools for manipulating alignments in SAM and BAM formats. 
A common task is to convert SAM files ("Sequence Alignment/Map") to BAM files.
BAM files are compressed versions of SAM files and are much smaller in size; the "B" stands for "binary".
BAM files are easy to manipulate and are ideal for storing large nucleotide sequence alignments. 

<!--T:47-->
CRAM is a more recent format for the same type of data, and offers still greater compression.

=== Converting a SAM file to a BAM file === <!--T:15-->

<!--T:16-->
Prior to converting, verify if your SAM file carries a header section with character “@”. You can inspect the header section using the view command:

</translate>
{{Command|samtools view -H my_sample.sam}}
<translate>

<!--T:18-->
If the SAM file contains a header, either of these forms can be used to convert the data to BAM format:

</translate>
{{Commands
|samtools view -bo my_sample.bam my_sample.sam
|samtools view -b my_sample.sam -o my_sample.bam}}
<translate>

<!--T:22-->
If headers are absent, you can use the reference FASTA file to map the reads:

</translate>
{{Command|samtools view -bt ref_seq.fa -o my_sample.bam my_sample.sam}}
<translate>

=== Sorting and indexing BAM files === <!--T:24-->

<!--T:25-->
You may also have to sort and index BAM files for many downstream applications

<!--T:26-->
{{Commands
|samtools sort my_sample.bam -o my_sample_sorted.bam
|samtools index my_sample_sorted.bam}}

<!--T:27-->
You can also convert a SAM file directly to a sorted BAM file using the shell pipe:

<!--T:28-->
{{Command|
[name@server ~]$ samtools view -b my_sample.sam | samtools sort -o my_sample_sorted.bam}}

<!--T:29-->
A sorted BAM file, together with its index file with extension <code>.bai</code>, is a common prerequisite for many other processes such as variant calling, feature counting, etc.

=== Processing multiple files with multithreading and/or GNU parallel === <!--T:48-->

<!--T:49-->
You will typically have more than one SAM file to process at one time.
A job script with a loop is a good way to handle multiple files, as in the following example: 

</translate>
{{File
|name=samtools.sh
|lang="bash"
|contents=
#!/bin/bash            
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 1
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G      
#SBATCH --time=3:00:00 

module load samtools/1.20

for FILE in *.sam
do
  time samtools view -b ${FILE} {{!}} samtools sort -o ${FILE%.*}_mt_sorted.bam
done
}}
<translate>

<!--T:34-->
Samtools typically runs on a single core by default but in some cases it may improve your efficiency to use multithreading or GNU parallel. 

<!--T:35-->
Samtools can take advantage of multiple cores ("multithreading") if given the <code>-@</code> flag: 

</translate>
{{File
|name=samtools_multithreading.sh
|lang="bash"
|contents=
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 4
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G
#SBATCH --time=3:00:00

module load samtools/1.20

for FILE in *.sam
do
  time samtools view -@ ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} -b ${FILE} {{!}} samtools sort -o ${FILE%.*}_mt_sorted.bam
done
}}
<translate>

<!--T:40-->
A different way to take advantage of multiple cores is to use GNU parallel to process multiple files concurrently:

</translate>
{{File
|name=samtools_gnuparallel.sh
|lang="bash"
|contents=
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 4
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G
#SBATCH --time=3:00:00

module load samtools/1.20

find . -name "*.sam" {{!}} parallel -j ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK} "time samtools view -bS {} {{!}} samtools sort -o {.}_mt_sorted.bam"
}}
<translate>

<!--T:44-->
The above script will execute <tt>view</tt> and <tt>sort</tt> on four SAM files concurrently. 
If you have more input files, modify the <tt>--cpous-per-task</tt> request.
