We are frequently asked about ArcGIS, which is commercial software.  
Due to the cost, licensing restrictions and complexity of its configuration, we do not support ArcGIS on our clusters.
We recommend you contact your institution's IT services department or the vendor [https://www.esri.com Esri] to see what options are available for you, 
either on your personal computer, at your institution, or through a commercial cloud provider like [https://aws.amazon.com/?nc1=h_ls AWS] or [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/ Azure].
