[https://opencv.org/ OpenCV] (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.

== CUDA ==
OpenCV is also available with CUDA.
{{Command|module load gcc cuda opencv/X.Y.Z}}
where <TT>X.Y.Z</TT> represent the desired version.

== Extra modules ==
The module also contains the [https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/4.x/modules#an-overview-of-the-opencv_contrib-modules extra modules (contrib)].

== Python bindings ==
The module contains bindings for multiple Python versions. 
To discover which are the compatible Python versions, run
{{Command|module spider opencv/X.Y.Z}}
Or search directly <i>opencv_python</i>, by running
{{Command|module spider opencv_python/X.Y.Z}}
where <TT>X.Y.Z</TT> represent the desired version.

=== Usage ===
1. Load the required modules.
{{Command|module load gcc opencv/X.Y.Z python scipy-stack}}
where <TT>X.Y.Z</TT> represent the desired version.

2. Import OpenCV.
{{Command|python -c "import cv2"}}

If the command displays nothing, the import was successful.

==== Available Python packages  ====
Other Python packages depend on OpenCV bindings in order to be installed.
OpenCV provides four different packages:
* <code>opencv_python</code>
* <code>opencv_contrib_python</code>
* <code>opencv_python_headless</code>
* <code>opencv_contrib_python_headless</code>

{{Command
|pip list {{!}} grep opencv
|result=
opencv-contrib-python              4.5.5                  
opencv-contrib-python-headless     4.5.5                  
opencv-python                      4.5.5                  
opencv-python-headless             4.5.5 
}}

With the <code>opencv</code> module loaded, your package dependency for one of the OpenCV named will be satisfied.

== Use with OpenEXR ==
In order to read EXR files with OpenCV, the module must be activated through an environment variable.
{{Command|OPENCV_IO_ENABLE_OPENEXR{{=}}1 python <file>}}
