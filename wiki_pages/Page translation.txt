To translate a page, one first writes the content in the original language. Second, the page is marked for translation. Then, a ''human'' translates the page using organizational tools provided by the wiki extension [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Translate Translate]. Tutorials for this extension can be found [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Extension:Translate here]. Finally, a second human reviews the translation. If a page has not yet been translated, users can see the page in the original language. If a translation has not yet been reviewed, users can see the non-reviewed translation.

Marking a page for translation will trigger an analysis of the content of the wiki page. The page content will be split by the extension into so-called translation units. Translation units can be a title, a paragraph, an image, etc. These small units can then be translated one by one, ensuring that a modification to a page does not trigger the translation of the whole page. This also allows tracking of what percentage of a page is translated, or outdated. 

==How does one mark a new page for translation ?== <!--T:3-->
When you have written a page, you should tag it for translation. Here are the steps to do so:
#Ensure that the wiki code to be translated is enclosed within &lt;translate&gt; &lt;/translate&gt; tags. 
#Ensure that the tag &lt;languages /&gt; appear at the very top of the page. This will show a box
#Go in “View” mode, and then click on the “Mark this page for translation” 
#Review the translation units. 
##Try to ensure that no wiki code (tables, tags, etc.) gets translated. This can be done by breaking the page in multiple &lt;translate&gt; &lt;/translate&gt; sections.
#In the “Priority languages” section, write either “fr” or “en” as the priority language, that is, the language into which it needs to be translated.
#Click on “Mark this version for translation”

==How does one mark changes to a page for translation ?== <!--T:4-->
First, try to mark a page for translation only once it is stable. 
Second, if you do have to make a change to a page that has been translated, make sure you do NOT change the tags of the form &lt;!--T:3--&gt;. Those are automatically generated. 

<!--T:5-->
Once you have done your edits, you can mark the changes to be translated by doing the following : 
#Ensure that the new text to be translated is enclosed within &lt;translate&gt; &lt;/translate&gt; tags. 
#Go in “View” mode. You should see the text “This page has changes since it was last marked for translation.” at the top of the page. Click on “marked for translation”.
#Review the translation units. 
##Try to ensure that no wiki code (tables, tags, etc.) gets translated. This can be done by breaking the page in multiple &lt;translate&gt; &lt;/translate&gt; sections.
#In the “Priority languages” section, write either “fr” or “en” as the priority language, that is, the language into which it needs to be translated.
#Click on “Mark this version for translation”
