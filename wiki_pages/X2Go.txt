# Once you open X2Go client, you will be presented with a screen looking like the "X2Go main screen" on the right of this page.
# Click on the icon that represents a file with a little star. This will prompt the screen "X2Go new session"
# Fill in the required information as displayed on the image. Make sure that you select the "'''ICEWM'''" desktop from the "Session drop-down menu, as this is the only desktop supported on Cedar. 
## It is a good practice to disable "Sound support" and "Client-side printing support" on the "Media" tab. These are less useful for HPC machines.
## It is possible to use SSH key-based authentication if you have it enabled, by providing your key ("Use RSA/DSA key for ssh connection" dialog). However, on Cedar default authentication is password-based. 
# Once the session is created, click on it (it will appear int he main window, enter your username and password, and wait. It may take a few minutes until the desktop appears, but once it appeared, it should be reasonably fast.
