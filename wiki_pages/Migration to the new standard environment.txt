= What are the differences between <tt>StdEnv/2023</tt> and the earlier environments? = <!--T:1-->
The differences are discussed in [[Standard software environments]].

= Can I change my default standard environment? = <!--T:2-->
After 2024 April 1, ''' <code>StdEnv/2023</code> will be the default environment for all clusters.''' However, you can specify your own default environment at any time by modifying the <code>$HOME/.modulerc</code> file.  For example, running the following command will set your default environment to <code>StdEnv/2020</code>:
{{Command|echo "module-version StdEnv/2020 default" >> $HOME/.modulerc}}
You must log out and log in again for this change to take effect.

= Do I need to reinstall/recompile my code when the <code>StdEnv</code> changes? = <!--T:3-->
Yes. If you compile your own code, or have installed R or Python packages, you should recompile your code or reinstall the packages you need with the newest version of the standard environment.

= How can I use an earlier environment? = <!--T:4-->
If you have an existing workflow and want to continue to use the same software versions you are using now, simply add 
  module load StdEnv/2020
to your job scripts before loading any other modules.  

= Will the earlier environments be removed? = <!--T:5-->
The earlier environments and any software dependent on them will remain available, <b>but versions 2016.4 and 2018.3 are no longer supported</b>, and we recommend not using them. Our staff will only install software in the new environment 2023.

= Can I mix modules from different environments? = <!--T:6-->
No, you should use a single environment for a given job - different jobs can use different standard environments by explicitly 
loading one or the other at the job's beginning but within a single job you should only use a single environment. The results of trying to mix different environments are unpredictable but in general will lead to errors of one kind or another. 

= Which environment should I use? = <!--T:7-->
If you are starting a new project, or if you want to use a newer version of an application, you should use <tt>StdEnv/2023</tt> by adding 
  module load StdEnv/2023
to your job scripts. This command does not need to be deleted to use <tt>StdEnv/2023</tt> after April 1.

= Can I keep using an older environment by loading modules in my <code>.bashrc</code>? = <!--T:8-->
Loading modules in your <code>.bashrc</code> is '''not recommended'''. Instead, explicitly load modules in your job scripts.

= I don't use the HPC clusters but cloud resources only. Do I need to worry about this? = <!--T:9-->
No, this change will only affect the [[Available software]] accessed by [[Using modules| using environment modules]].

= I can no longer load a module that I previously used = <!--T:10-->
More recent versions of most applications are installed in the new environment. To see the available versions, run the <code>module avail</code> command. For example,  
{{Command|module avail gcc}}
shows several versions of the GCC compilers, which may be different from those in earlier environments.
