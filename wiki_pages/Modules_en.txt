In computing, a module is a unit of software that is designed to be independent, interchangeable, and contains everything necessary to provide the desired functionality.
<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming Wikipedia, "Modular programming"]</ref>
The term "module" may sometimes have a more specific meaning depending on the context.
This page describes a few types of modules and suggests links to further documentation content. 

== Disambiguation ==

=== Lmod modules ===

Also called "environment modules", Lmod modules are used to alter your (shell) environment so as to enable you to use a particular software package,
or to use a non-default version of certain common software packages such as compilers.  See [[Using modules]].

=== Python modules ===

In Python, a module is a file of code (usually Python code) which can be loaded with the <code>import ...</code> or <code>from ... import ...</code> statements to provide functionality.  A Python package is a collection of Python modules; the terms "package" and "module" are frequently interchanged in casual use.
<ref>[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-python-module-and-a-python-package Tutorialspoint.com, "What is the difference between a python module and a python package?"]</ref>

Certain frequently used Python modules such as Numpy can be imported if you first load the <code>scipy-stack</code> Lmod module at the shell level.
See [[Python#SciPy_stack|SciPy stack]] for details.

We maintain a large collection of [[Python#Available_wheels|Python "wheels."]]
These are modules which are pre-compiled to be compatible with the [[Standard software environments]].
Before importing modules from our wheels, you should create a [[Python#Creating_and_using_a_virtual_environment|virtual environment]].  

Python modules which are not in the <code>scipy-stack</code> Lmod module or in our wheels collection can be installed from the internet
as described in the [[Python#Installing_packages|Installing packages]] section.
