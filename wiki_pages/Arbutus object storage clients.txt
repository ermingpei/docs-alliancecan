For information on obtaining Arbutus Object Storage, please see [[Arbutus object storage|this page]]. For information on how to use an object storage client to manage your Arbutus object store, choose a client and follow instructions from these pages:
* [[ Accessing object storage with s3cmd ]]
* [[ Accessing object storage with WinSCP ]]
* [[Accessing the Arbutus object storage with AWS CLI ]]
* [[Globus#Object_storage_on_Arbutus|Accessing the Arbutus object storage with Globus]]

<!--T:2-->
It is important to note that Arbutus' Object Storage solution does not use Amazon's [https://documentation.help/s3-dg-20060301/VirtualHosting.html S3 Virtual Hosting] (i.e. DNS-based bucket) approach which these clients assume by default. They need to be configured not to use that approach, as described in the pages linked above.
