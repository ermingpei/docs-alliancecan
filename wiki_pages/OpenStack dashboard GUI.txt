== OpenStack dashboard GUI ==
The OpenStack dashboard GUI allows you manage various aspects of your OpenStack cloud project.  This includes to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) and networks. The GUI is based on software from the OpenStack project called Horizon.  The GUI can be used from any machine, virtual or otherwise, and only requires having an internet connection and a web browser.  For example, the dashboard shows a project's used resources and available quota:

The [[OpenStack command line clients]] allows you to perform functionality which the dashboard does not.
