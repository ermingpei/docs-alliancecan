==Latest available wheels==

To see the latest version of <tt>spaCy</tt> that we have built:
{{Command|avail_wheels spacy thinc thinc_gpu_ops}}
For more information on listing wheels, see [[Python#Listing_available_wheels | listing available wheels]].

==Pre-build==

The preferred option is to install it using the python [https://pythonwheels.com/ wheel] that we compile, as follows: 
:1. Load python 3.6 module: <tt>python/3.6</tt>
:2. Create and activate a [[Python#Creating_and_using_a_virtual_environment|virtual environment]].
:3. Install <tt>spaCy</tt> in the virtual environment with <code>pip install</code>. For both GPU and CPU support:
:{{Command|prompt=(venv) [name@server ~]|pip install spacy[cuda] --no-index}}
:If you only need CPU support:
:{{Command|prompt=(venv) [name@server ~]|pip install spacy --no-index}}

'''GPU version''': At the present time, in order to use the GPU version you need to add the CUDA libraries to <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</tt>:
{{Commands
|prompt=(venv) [name@server ~]
|module load gcc/5.4.0 cuda/9
|export LD_LIBRARY_PATH{{=}}$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
}}

If you want to use the [https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/PyTorch Pytorch] wrapper with <tt>thinc</tt>, you'll also need to install the <tt>torch_cpu</tt> or  <tt>torch_gpu</tt> wheel.
