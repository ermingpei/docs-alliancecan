Installation of software packages within the Alliance software environment is always performed using scripts. We use multiple tools, including [https://easybuild.io/ EasyBuild], [https://overlays.gentoo.org/ Gentoo Overlays] (starting in 2020), and [https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs NixOS] (formerly). This software environment can be [[Accessing CVMFS|used on any computer in the world]] thanks to [https://cvmfs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ CVMFS]. 

We also track all changes and new installations made to the software environment through [[Git]], and you can see a list of recent changes in the links below.
