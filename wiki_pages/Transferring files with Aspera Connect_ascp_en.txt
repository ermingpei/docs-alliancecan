ascp is a software used for transferring data to and from Aspera transfer servers where you have license credentials. A common use case is uploading a dataset to a data repository. 

Many transfer servers will require an up-to-date version of the software (now called Aspera Connect). Due to changes in the software, you may need to install this updated version locally. Please see below for details.

=ascp 3.5.4=
This software is available as a module in older software stacks.

If the server you are trying to transfer data to is incompatible with this older version, you may get an error such as

<pre>
Error with Aspera:

ascp: failed to authenticate, exiting.

Session Stop  (Error: failed to authenticate)
</pre>

=Aspera Connect/ascp 4+=
