= The Jupyter vocabulary and related wiki pages =
* '''Jupyter''': an implementation of Web applications and notebook rendering
** ''Google Colab'' would be another implementation of the same kind of environment
* '''Jupyter Application''': like a regular application, but is displayed in a separate Web browser tab. The application has access to the data stored remotely on the server, and the heavy computations are also handled by the remote server
* [[JupyterHub|'''JupyterHub''': a Web server hosting Jupyter portals and kernels]]

== JupyterLab ==
A Web portal with a modern interface for managing and running applications, as well as rendering notebook files of various kernels. For more details:
* [[JupyterHub#JupyterLab|'''JupyterLab via JupyterHub''': a pre-installed JupyterLab environment]], with a default Python kernel and the access to software modules
* [[Advanced_Jupyter_configuration|'''JupyterLab from a virtual environment''': a self-made environment]] to be launched by a Slurm job

== Jupyter Notebook ==
An older Web portal for managing and running applications, as well as rendering notebook files of various kernels. For more details:
* [[JupyterHub#User_Interface|'''Jupyter Notebook via JupyterHub''': a pre-installed Jupyter Notebook environment]], with a default Python kernel and the access to software modules
* [[JupyterNotebook|'''Jupyter Notebook from a virtual environment''': a self-made environment]] to be launched by a Slurm job

== Kernel ==
The active service behind the Web interface. There are:
* Notebook kernels (e.g. Python, R, Julia)
* Application kernels (e.g. RStudio, VSCode)

== Notebook ==
A page of executable cells of code and formatted text:
* '''IPython notebooks''': a notebook executed by a Python kernel, and has some IPython interactive special commands that are not supported by a regular Python shell
