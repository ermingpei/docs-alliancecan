== Description ==

"[https://simtk.org/projects/opensim OpenSim] is a freely available, user extensible software system that lets users develop models of musculoskeletal structures and create dynamic simulations of movement. " 
OpenSim includes Python and Matlab APIs. It is commonly used with [https://opensim-org.github.io/opensim-moco-site/ OpenSim Moco].

The OpenSim module available through our software stack includes support for OpenSim Moco, as well as bindings to enable scripting in Python or Matlab.

== Using OpenSim via Matlab ==

=== Setup ===
Before first use of OpenSim on a cluster, you must configure the necessary Java paths, by running:
{{Command|matlab -batch "cd ${EBROOTOPENSIM}/share/doc/OpenSim/Code/Matlab/; configureOpenSim"}}
After exiting and relaunching Matlab, you can verify that OpenSim is imported by running in Matlab: <code> org.opensim.modeling.opensimCommon.GetVersion()</code>

== Using OpenSim via Python ==

In order to use the OpenSim Python package, an OpenSim module must be loaded, and a numpy package must be available through a [[Python#Creating and using a virtual environment | virtual environment ]] or loading a [[Python#SciPy stack | scipy-stack]] module. You should subsequently be able to import the <code>opensim</code> package in Python.
