Cloud Account Lifecycle Management (CALM) is the process by which projects and accounts are provisioned and eventually deprovisioned throughout a lifecycle.

The type of lifecycle which is tied to the type of allocation given the PI/group by CCDB/the Alliance.

Upon provisioning a cloud project, CCDB accounts are given roles which provide access the project on the cloud infrastructure

‘Local’ accounts are used within VMs and outside the scope of CALM
