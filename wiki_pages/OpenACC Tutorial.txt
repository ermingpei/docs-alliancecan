<!--T:9-->
This tutorial is strongly inspired from the OpenACC Bootcamp session presented at [http://www.gputechconf.com/ GPU Technology Conference 2016]. 

<!--T:2-->
OpenACC is an application programming interface (API) for porting code onto accelerators such as GPU and coprocessors. It has been developed by Cray, CAPS, NVidia and PGI. Like in [[OpenMP]], the programmer annotates C, C++ or Fortran code to identify portions that should be parallelized by the compiler.

A self-paced course on this topic is available from SHARCNET: [https://training.sharcnet.ca/courses/enrol/index.php?id=173 Introduction to GPU Programming].
