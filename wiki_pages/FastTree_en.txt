[https://morgannprice.github.io/fasttree/ FastTree] infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. FastTree can handle alignments with up to a million sequences in a reasonable amount of time and memory.

= Environment modules =

We offer software modules for single precision and double precision calculations. Single precision is faster while double precision is more precise. Double precision is recommended when using a highly biased transition matrix, or if you want to resolve very short branches accurately.

To see the available FastTree modules:

 module spider fasttree

To load a single precision module:

 module load fasttree/2.1.11

To load a double precision module:

 module load fasttree-double/2.1.11

= Troubleshooting =

* Error message ''WARNING! This alignment consists of closely-related and very long sequences'': This likely results in very short and sometimes negative branch lengths. Use a <code>fasttree-double</code> module for double precision.
