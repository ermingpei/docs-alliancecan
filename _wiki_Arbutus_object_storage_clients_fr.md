For information on how to obtain object storage space on Arbutus, see [this wiki page](link_to_wiki_page_needed).  See also information on the clients:

* [Object Storage: Access with s3cmd](link_to_s3cmd_page_needed)
* [Object Storage: Access with WinSCP](link_to_WinSCP_page_needed)
* [Object Storage: Access with AWS CLI](link_to_AWS_CLI_page_needed)
* [Arbutus Object Storage: Access via Globus](link_to_Globus_page_needed)


It should be noted that the Arbutus object storage solution does not use Amazon's S3 Virtual Hosting approach with DNS buckets, unlike these clients which offer it by default.  To avoid using this approach, the clients must be configured accordingly.
