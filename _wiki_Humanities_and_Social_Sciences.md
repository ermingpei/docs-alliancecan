# Humanities and Social Sciences

## Introduction

Scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences (HSS) are using increasingly complex computational tools, methods, and techniques in their research. There are three elements of the current landscape that place the HSS in a position for rapid growth:

* increasing open source data;
* increasing access to significant computing power and tools; and
* growing research computing competency among humanities researchers.

To support researchers in the HSS, the Digital Research Alliance of Canada has a dedicated team of professionals. For more information, please contact the HSS Team using the support email address found on this page, adding `(HSS)` at the beginning of the subject. Alternatively, you are welcome to request a specific staff member; consult the list of names below to find the appropriate person to contact.
