Nibi, the Anishinaabemowin word for water, is the successor of Graham and a general-purpose cluster of 134,400 CPU cores and 288 H100 NVIDIA GPUs.  It was built by [Hypertec](https://www.hypertec.com/), hosted and operated by [SHARCNET](https://www.sharcnet.ca/) at the University of Waterloo.  It is expected that Nibi will come online by July 1, 2025.

## Storage

**Parallel storage:** 25 petabytes, all SSD from [VAST Data](https://www.vastdata.com/) for `/home`, `/project`, and `/scratch`. This is the same storage as used by miniGraham.

## Interconnect Fabric

*   Nokia 200/400G ethernet
*   200 Gbit/s network bandwidth for CPU nodes.
*   400 Gbit/s non-blocking network bandwidth between all Nvidia GPU nodes.
*   200 Gbit/s network bandwidth between all AMD GPU nodes.
*   24x100 Gbit/s connection to the VAST storage nodes.
*   2:1 blocking at 400 Gbit/s uplinks for all compute nodes.
