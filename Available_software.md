# Available Software

Other languages: English, français

A current list of the software available on our national systems is below. This list changes frequently as new software is added. You can request the installation or updating of a particular program or library by contacting [technical support](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Technical_support). If you wish to use our software environment on your own system, please see [Accessing CVMFS](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Accessing_CVMFS).

## Notes

Except for basic system programs, you access most software by loading a [module](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Using_modules). See [Using modules](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Using_modules) for more on how to use the Lmod module system. Note that some prerequisite modules are loaded by default.

Here are a few things to know about the available software:

Most Python modules are not installed as (Lmod) modules. They are instead provided as binary wheels, stored on our systems under `/cvmfs/soft.computecanada.ca/custom/python/wheelhouse/`. One such package is TensorFlow. For instructions on how to install or list Python packages, see the Python page.

Similarly, most R or Perl packages are not installed either. We recommend installing them in your personal or group file space. See the R and Perl pages for instructions on how to do so.

A page discusses [symbolic algebra software](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Symbolic_algebra_software) like Mathematica and Sage.

Note that Docker is not available on our clusters but Apptainer is available by loading the module `apptainer`. Docker containers can be converted to Apptainer as discussed [here](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Docker_to_Apptainer).

Some of the software packages listed below are not immediately usable because they require you to have a license. You may need to be granted access to them by us. Attempting to load the module for one of these will give you instructions on what to do to obtain access.

While the vast majority of the software packages below are accessible on all our servers, a few are only available at one site or another due to licensing restrictions. See [Site-specific software](#site-specific-software) below.

The packages listed below are available in one or more [standard software environments](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Standard_software_environments). In rare circumstances it may be necessary to load a different standard environment (StdEnv) to access a particular version of a particular package. For more on this please read [Standard software environments](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Standard_software_environments).

Many packages related to the operating system, such as Autotools, Make, Git, and others, are not installed as modules but are part of the default environment. These are not listed below.


### Niagara

The Niagara cluster is an exception to this page and more information about the software available on this cluster can be found on the [Niagara Quick Start Guide](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/mediawiki/index.php?title=Niagara_Quick_Start_Guide). However, you can still have access to the modules below on Niagara if you first run the following commands:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ module load CCEnv
[name@server ~]$ module load StdEnv
```


## List of globally-installed modules

The table below lists software for which an environment module has been installed on our systems. In simple cases, the module name listed in the Module column can be used with the `module load` command to configure your environment. In more complicated cases, some prerequisite modules may also need to be loaded. Click on the corresponding [Expand] link in the Description column for a list of prerequisites and brief notes about the software. If more extensive documentation about a package is available, there will be a link in the Documentation column. Click the double arrows in the column heading to sort in ascending or descending order for a given column. In particular, sorting by software type might be of interest. The Type column shows the software tagged as: ai (artificial intelligence), bio (biology, bioinformatics), chem (chemistry), geo (earth sciences), io (input/output), math (mathematics), mpi (MPI), phys (physics and engineering), tools (languages and libraries), vis (visualization).

|  |  |  | ✓ | atomicrex | chem | 1.0.20181114 | Description: atomicrex is a versatile tool for the construction of advanced atomistic models. It is written in C++ and Python. It was primarily developed to fit interatomic potential models. Thanks to its flexible generic structure its application range, however, is much larger. In a general sense, it allows one to develop models that describe a given property as a function of an atomic (or atom-like) configuration. The property in question can be scalar or vectorial in nature, and could represent e.g., total energies and forces, or eventually electronic eigen energies. It thus provides already the basic framework for constructing in the future for example tight binding models.
