# GIS

GIS is an acronym for a **geographic information system**.

For a brief overview of GIS software, see [here](link-to-overview-page-needed).

Of the titles mentioned in that overview, the following are available on our clusters:

*   QGIS
*   GRASS
*   GDAL
*   SAGA

You may find others by checking the list of [available software](link-to-software-list-needed) and looking for entries with type "geo".

GIS packages for R and Python will not appear there; please see [R](link-to-R-page-needed) and [Python](link-to-Python-page-needed) for more about finding and installing packages for those languages.

We are frequently asked about ArcGIS, which is commercial software. Due to the cost, licensing restrictions, and complexity of its configuration, we do not support ArcGIS on our clusters.  We recommend you contact your institution's IT services department or the vendor [Esri](https://www.esri.com/) to see what options are available for you, either on your personal computer, at your institution, or through a commercial cloud provider like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
