# Cloud Storage Options

Other languages: English, fran√ßais

The existing storage types available in our clouds are:

## Volume Storage

The standard storage unit for cloud computing; can be attached to and detached from an instance.

## Ephemeral/Disk Storage

Virtual local disk storage tied to the lifecycle of a single instance on a hypervisor's local disk ("c" flavor local disk can be lost).

## Object Storage

Non-hierarchical storage where data is created or uploaded in whole-file form.

## Shared Filesystem Storage

Private network attached storage space (similar to NFS/SMB shares); must be configured on each instance where it is mounted.


## Comparison of Storage Types

Attributes of each storage type are compared in the following table:
