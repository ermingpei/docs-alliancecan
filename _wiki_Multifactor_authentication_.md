# Multifactor Authentication

Multifactor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to your AllianceCAN account.  It requires you to verify your identity using two or more factors, making it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to access your account even if they obtain your password.

We strongly recommend enabling MFA for all your AllianceCAN accounts.

## Enabling Multifactor Authentication

To enable MFA, follow these steps:

1. **Log in** to your AllianceCAN account.
2. Navigate to your **account settings**.  (The exact location of this may vary depending on the specific application or service.)
3. Look for the **Multifactor Authentication** or similar setting.
4. **Enable** MFA.  You'll likely be presented with several options; choose one that works best for you (e.g., authenticator app, security key, SMS).
5. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to complete the setup process. This will usually involve scanning a QR code with an authenticator app, or entering a code sent via SMS or email.
6. **Test your setup** by attempting to log in. You should be prompted to enter the code generated by your chosen MFA method.

## Supported Methods

AllianceCAN may support various MFA methods, including but not limited to:

* **Authenticator App (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy):**  This is generally the most secure method.  You'll need to install a compatible app on your smartphone or other device.
* **Security Key:**  A physical device that plugs into your computer's USB port or connects via NFC.
* **SMS (Text Message):**  A code is sent to your registered mobile phone number.  While convenient, this method is generally less secure than authenticator apps or security keys.
* **Email:** Similar to SMS, but a code is sent to your registered email address.  This method is also less secure than authenticator apps or security keys.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems enabling or using MFA, please contact AllianceCAN support.  Be prepared to provide details about the specific method you're using and any error messages you've received.

## Importance of MFA

Using MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your account.  Even if your password is compromised, an attacker will still need access to your second factor (e.g., your authenticator app or security key) to log in.  This makes your account much more secure.  We strongly encourage you to enable MFA on all your accounts where it is available.
