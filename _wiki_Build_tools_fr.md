# Build Tools

These tools are used to manage the development process and, as much as possible, automate it. They allow linking and compiling a set of source files and libraries to create executables, taking into account the specifics of each platform. Calcul Canada provides users with the most common Linux tools:

*   `make`
*   Autotools
*   CMake
