GIS is the acronym for **Geographic Information System** (see Système d'information géographique).

For an overview of this software, see [Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](link-to-geospatial-concepts).  Among the software mentioned, the following are available on our clusters:

* QGIS
* GRASS
* GDAL
* SAGA

It is possible that other systems will be added to the list of modules available on our clusters. Click on the column header "Type"; the type "geo" identifies these systems.

However, this list does not include R or Python packages; consult these pages to locate and install these packages.


We receive several questions about the commercial software ArcGIS. This product is not available on our clusters due to its cost, license limitations, and configuration difficulties. We recommend contacting your institution's IT services or [Esri](link-to-esri) to find out what options are available for your personal computer, your institution, or via a commercial cloud provider such as [AWS](link-to-aws) or [Azure](link-to-azure).
