# Quantum Computing Services

## Overview

Our team of quantum computing analysts offers expertise, support, and training in quantum computing and classical-quantum hybrid computing.  As of January 2025, Calcul Québec offers access to a 24-qubit superconducting quantum computer, MonarQ, available via the Narval cluster. See our [MonarQ](MonarQ_link_here) page for more details.

To get started with MonarQ, refer to [Getting Started with MonarQ](Getting_Started_link_here).

**What is Quantum Computing?**

A quantum computer exploits the characteristics of quantum particles (qubits), including superposition of states; constructive and destructive interference; and entanglement.  Thanks to these properties, a new paradigm of computation is in place, promising greater parallelization for solving complex problems that remain unsolvable for classical computer systems.


## Applications

The optimization of complex problems is one of the most promising areas for quantum computing and can be applied to several research areas:

* **Machine Learning:** Quantum computers could reduce training times and processing delays.
* **Finance:** Quantum computers could accelerate portfolio risk assessment and fraud detection.
* **Molecular Modeling:** Quantum computers could simulate more complex chemical systems and simulate reactions in real time.
* **Meteorology:** Quantum computers could increase the number of variables for weather forecasting.
* **Logistics:** Quantum computers could optimize logistics and workflow planning associated with supply chain management.


## Quantum Computing Software

Several specialized software libraries exist for quantum computing and for developing quantum algorithms. These libraries allow you to build circuits that are executed on simulators that mimic the performance and results obtained on a quantum computer. They can be used on all Alliance clusters.

* PennyLane (Python library)
* Snowflurry (Julia library)
* Qiskit (Python library)


## Training

Our team of analysts offers theoretical and practical training sessions for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels. They are offered online or in person at one of our university sites, in French or English.

Currently offered trainings are:

* CIQ101, Introduction to Quantum Computing Theory
* CIQ102, Introduction to Quantum Programming with PennyLane
* MNQ101, Getting Started with MonarQ, Calcul Québec's quantum computer


## Research Assistance and Technical Support

We offer research support in quantum computing, including consultations, personalized technical support, and an assessment of the feasibility of your projects on MonarQ.
