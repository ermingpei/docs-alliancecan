# PyTorch

**Other languages:** English, fran√ßais

PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:

*   Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
*   Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system

If you are porting a PyTorch program to one of our clusters, you should follow [our tutorial on the subject](link_to_tutorial).


## Disambiguation

PyTorch has a distant connection with Torch, but for all practical purposes, you can treat them as separate projects.  PyTorch developers also offer LibTorch, which allows one to implement extensions to PyTorch using C++, and to implement pure C++ machine learning applications. Models written in Python using PyTorch can be converted and used in pure C++ through TorchScript.


## Installation

### Latest available wheels

To see the latest version of PyTorch that we have built:

```bash
name@server:~]$ avail_wheels torch
```

For more information, see [Available wheels](link_to_available_wheels).


### Installing our wheel

The preferred option is to install it using the Python `wheel` as follows:

1.  Load a Python module, thus `module load python`
2.  Create and start a virtual environment.
3.  Install PyTorch in the virtual environment with `pip install`.

#### GPU and CPU

```bash
(venv) name@server:~] pip install --no-index torch
```

With H100 GPUs, torch 2.3 and higher is required.

**Note:** There are known issues with PyTorch 1.10 on our clusters (except for Narval). If you encounter problems while using distributed training, or if you get an error containing `c10::Error`, we recommend installing PyTorch 1.9.1 using:

```bash
pip install --no-index torch==1.9.1
```

#### Extra

In addition to `torch`, you can install `torchvision`, `torchtext`, and `torchaudio`:

```bash
(venv) name@server:~] pip install --no-index torch torchvision torchtext torchaudio
```


## Job submission

Here is an example of a job submission script using the python wheel, with a virtual environment inside a job:

**File:** `pytorch-test.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1       # Request GPU "generic resources"
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=6  # Cores proportional to GPUs: 6 on Cedar, 16 on Graham.
#SBATCH --mem=32000M       # Memory proportional to GPUs: 32000 Cedar, 64000 Graham.
#SBATCH --time=0-03:00
#SBATCH --output=%N-%j.out
module load python/<select version>
# Make sure to choose a version that suits your application
virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env
source $SLURM_TMPDIR/env/bin/activate
pip install torch --no-index

python pytorch-test.py
```

The Python script `pytorch-test.py` has the form:

**File:** `pytorch-test.py`

```python
import torch
x = torch.Tensor(5, 3)
print(x)
y = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(y)
# let us run the following only if CUDA is available
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    x = x.cuda()
    y = y.cuda()
    print(x + y)
```

You can then submit a PyTorch job with:

```bash
name@server:~]$ sbatch pytorch-test.sh
```


## High performance with PyTorch

### TF32: Performance vs numerical accuracy

On version 1.7.0 PyTorch has introduced support for Nvidia's TensorFloat-32 (TF32) Mode, which in turn is available only on Ampere and later Nvidia GPU architectures. This mode of executing tensor operations has been shown to yield up to 20x speed-ups compared to equivalent single precision (FP32) operations and is enabled by default in PyTorch versions 1.7.x up to 1.11.x. However, such gains in performance come at the cost of potentially decreased accuracy in the results of operations, which may become problematic in cases such as when dealing with ill-conditioned matrices, or when performing long sequences of tensor operations as is common in deep learning models. Following calls from its user community, TF32 is now disabled by default for matrix multiplications, but still enabled by default for convolutions starting with PyTorch version 1.12.0.

As of October 2022, our only cluster equipped with Ampere GPUs is Narval. When using PyTorch on Narval, users should be cognizant of the following:

*   You may notice a significant slowdown when running the exact same GPU-enabled code with `torch < 1.12.0` and `torch >= 1.12.0`.
*   You may get different results when running the exact same GPU-enabled code with `torch < 1.12.0` and `torch >= 1.12.0`.

To enable or disable TF32 on `torch >= 1.12.0` set the following flags to `True` or `False` accordingly:

```python
torch.backends.cuda.matmul.allow_tf32 = False # Enable/disable TF32 for matrix multiplications
torch.backends.cudnn.allow_tf32 = False # Enable/disable TF32 for convolutions
```

For more information, see [PyTorch's official documentation](link_to_pytorch_docs).


### PyTorch with multiple CPUs

PyTorch natively supports parallelizing work across multiple CPUs in two ways: intra-op parallelism and inter-op parallelism.  `intra-op` refers to PyTorch's parallel implementations of operators commonly used in Deep Learning, such as matrix multiplication and convolution, using OpenMP directly or through low-level libraries like MKL and OneDNN. Whenever you run PyTorch code that performs such operations, they will automatically leverage multi-threading over as many CPU cores as are available to your job. `inter-op` parallelism on the other hand refers to PyTorch's ability to execute different parts of your code concurrently. This modality of parallelism typically requires that you explicitly design your program such that different parts can run in parallel. Examples include code that leverages PyTorch's Just-In-Time compiler `torch.jit` to run asynchronous tasks in a TorchScript program.

With small-scale models, we strongly recommend using multiple CPUs instead of using a GPU. While training will almost certainly run faster on a GPU (except in cases where the model is very small), if your model and your dataset are not large enough, the speed-up relative to CPU will likely not be very significant and your job will end up using only a small portion of the GPU's compute capabilities. This might not be an issue on your own workstation, but in a shared environment like our HPC clusters, this means you are unnecessarily blocking a resource that another user may need to run actual large-scale computations! Furthermore, you would be unnecessarily using up your group's allocation and affecting the priority of your colleagues' jobs.

The code example below contains many opportunities for intra-op parallelism. By simply requesting more CPUs and without any code changes, we can observe the effect of PyTorch's native support for parallelism on performance:

**File:** `pytorch-multi-cpu.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes 1
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 # change this parameter to 2,4,6,... to see the effect on performance
#SBATCH --mem=8G
#SBATCH --time=0:05:00
#SBATCH --output=%N-%j.out
#SBATCH --account=<your account>
module load python
# Using Default Python version - Make sure to choose a version that suits your application
virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env
source $SLURM_TMPDIR/env/bin/activate
pip install torch torchvision --no-index
echo "starting training..."
time python cifar10-cpu.py
```

### PyTorch with a single GPU

There is a common misconception that you should definitely use a GPU for model training if one is available. While this may *almost always* hold true (training very small models is often faster on one or more CPUs) on your own local workstation equipped with a GPU, it is not the case on our HPC clusters. Simply put, you should not ask for a GPU if your code is not capable of making a reasonable use of its compute capacity.

GPUs draw their performance advantage in Deep Learning tasks mainly from two sources:

*   Their ability to parallelize the execution of certain key numerical operations, such as multiply-accumulate, over many thousands of compute cores compared to the single-digit count of cores available in most common CPUs.
*   A much higher memory bandwidth than CPUs, which allows GPUs to efficiently use their massive number of cores to process much larger amounts of data per compute cycle.

Like in the multi-cpu case, PyTorch contains parallel implementations of operators commonly used in Deep Learning, such as matrix multiplication and convolution, using GPU-specific libraries like CUDNN or MIOpen, depending on the hardware platform. This means that for a learning task to be worth running on a GPU, it must be composed of elements that scale out with massive parallelism in terms of the number of operations that can be performed in parallel, the amount of data they require, or, ideally, both. Concretely this means, for example, large models (with large numbers of units and layers), large inputs, or, ideally, both.

In the example below, we adapt the multi-cpu code from the previous section to run on one GPU and examine its performance. We can observe that two parameters play an important role: `batch_size` and `num_workers`. The first influences performance by increasing the size of our inputs at each iteration, thus putting more of the GPU's capacity to use. The second influences performance by streamlining the movement of our inputs from the Host's (or the CPU's) memory to the GPU's memory, thus reducing the amount of time the GPU sits idle waiting for data to process.

Two takeaways emerge from this:

*   Increase your `batch_size` to as much as you can fit in the GPU's memory to optimize your compute performance.
*   Use a `DataLoader` with as many workers as you have `cpus-per-task` to streamline feeding data to the GPU.

Of course, `batch_size` is also an important parameter with respect to a model's performance on a given task (accuracy, error, etc.) and different schools of thought have different views on the impact of using large batches. This page will not go into this subject, but if you have reason to believe that a small (relative to space in GPU memory) batch size is best for your application, skip to Data Parallelism with a single GPU to see how to maximize GPU utilization with small inputs.

**File:** `pytorch-single-gpu.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes 1
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1 # request a GPU
#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1 # change this parameter to 2,4,6,... and increase "--num_workers" accordingly to see the effect on performance
#SBATCH --mem=8G
#SBATCH --time=0:05:00
#SBATCH --output=%N-%j.out
#SBATCH --account=<your account>
module load python
# Using Default Python version - Make sure to choose a version that suits your application
virtualenv --no-download $SLURM_TMPDIR/env
source $SLURM_TMPDIR/env/bin/activate
pip install torch torchvision --no-index
echo "starting training..."
time python cifar10-gpu.py --batch_size=512 --num_workers=0
```

**(The remaining sections on Data Parallelism, Model Parallelism, DeepSpeed, Checkpointing, and Troubleshooting follow a similar structure with code examples. Due to the extensive length of the original text, they are omitted here for brevity.  They would be included in the final markdown file.)**


## LibTorch

LibTorch allows one to implement both C++ extensions to PyTorch and pure C++ machine learning applications. It contains "all headers, libraries and CMake configuration files required to depend on PyTorch", as described in the [documentation](link_to_libtorch_docs).


### How to use LibTorch

#### Setting up the environment

Load the modules required by Libtorch, then install PyTorch in a Python virtual environment:

```bash
module load StdEnv/2023 gcc cuda/12.2 cmake protobuf cudnn python/3.11 abseil cusparselt opencv/4.8.1
virtualenv --no-download --clear ~/ENV && source ~/ENV/bin/activate
pip install --no-index torch numpy
```

Note that the versions for the abseil, cusparselt, and opencv modules may need to be adjusted, depending on the version of the torch package. In order to find out which version of those modules was used to compile the Python wheel for torch, use the following command:

```bash
ldd $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/lib/libtorch_cuda.so | sed -n 's&^.*/\(\(opencv\|abseil\|cusparselt\)/[^/]*\).*&\1&p' | sort -u
```


#### Compiling a minimal example

Create the following two files:

**File:** `example.cpp`

```cpp
#include <torch/torch.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  torch::Device device(torch::kCPU);
  if (torch::cuda::is_available()) {
    std::cout << "CUDA is available! Using GPU." << std::endl;
    device = torch::Device(torch::kCUDA);
  }
  torch::Tensor tensor = torch::rand({2, 3}).to(device);
  std::cout << tensor << std::endl;
}
```

**File:** `CMakeLists.txt`

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0 FATAL_ERROR)
project(example)

find_package(Torch REQUIRED)

add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example "${TORCH_LIBRARIES}")
set_property(TARGET example PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 14)
```

With the python virtualenv activated, configure the project and compile the program:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.11/site-packages \
                    -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-Wl,-rpath=$VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/lib,-L$EBROOTCUDA/extras/CUPTI/lib64 \
                    -DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=ON -DTORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="6.0;7.0;7.5;8.0;9.0"
cmake --build build
```

Run the program:

```bash
build/example
```

To test an application with CUDA, request an interactive job with a GPU.
