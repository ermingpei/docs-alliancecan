# GNU Profiler (gprof)

## What is gprof?

`gprof` is a profiling software that collects information and compiles statistics on your code.  Generally, it searches for functions and subroutines in your program and inserts timing instructions for each one. Executing such a modified program creates a raw data file which can be interpreted by `gprof` and turned into profiling statistics.

`gprof` comes with the GNU compiler suite and is available with the `gcc` module on our clusters.

## Preparing your application

### Loading the GNU compiler

Load the appropriate GNU compiler. For example, for GCC:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ module load gcc/7.3.0
```

### Compiling your code

To get useful information from `gprof`, you first need to compile your code with debugging information enabled. With the GNU compilers, you do so by adding the `-pg` option to the compilation command. This option tells the compiler to generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis. Without this option, no call-graph data will be gathered and you may get the following error:

```
gprof: gmon.out file is missing call-graph data
```

### Executing your code

Once your code has been compiled with the proper options, you then execute it:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ /path/to/your/executable arg1 arg2
```

You should run your code the same way as you would without `gprof` profiling; the execution line does not change.

Once the binary has been executed and finished without any errors, a new file `gmon.out` is created in the current working directory. Note that if your code changes the current working directory, `gmon.out` will be created in the new working directory, insofar as your program has sufficient permissions to do so.

### Getting the profiling data

In this step, the `gprof` tool is executed with the binary name and the above-mentioned `gmon.out` as an argument; the analysis file is created with all the desired profiling information.

```bash
[name@server ~]$ gprof /path/to/your/executable gmon.out > analysis.txt
```
