| bayestraits      | 3.0.1                                    | BayesTraits is a computer package for performing analyses of trait evolution among groups of species for which a phylogeny or sample of phylogenies is available.

Hypotheses can be tested about models of evolution, about ancestral states and about correlations among pairs of traits. | http://www.evolution.reading.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV1.html                           |

ParMETIS extends the functionality provided by METIS and includes routines that are especially suited for parallel AMR computations and large scale numerical simulations. The algorithms implemented in ParMETIS are based on the parallel multilevel k-way graph-partitioning, adaptive repartitioning, and parallel multi-constrained partitioning schemes. | http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview                           |
