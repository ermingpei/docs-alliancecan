The content of this tutorial is largely taken from the intensive training session on OpenACC held at the [GPU Technology Conference 2016](link-to-gtc-2016-here).

OpenACC (for *Open Accelerators*) is a programming interface API used to port code to accelerators such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and coprocessors. This programming standard for parallel computing was developed by Cray, CAPS, NVIDIA, and PGI.  Like OpenMP, the C, C++, or Fortran code is annotated by the programmer to identify the parts that the compiler should parallelize.

SHARCNET offers a self-paced training tutorial; click on [Introduction to GPU Programming](link-to-sharcnet-tutorial-here).


## Prerequisites

This tutorial demonstrates how to use OpenACC to accelerate programs in C, C++, or Fortran; a good knowledge of one of these languages will allow you to make the most of the exercises.


## Before You Begin
