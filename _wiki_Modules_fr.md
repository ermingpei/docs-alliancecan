In programming, a module is an independent and interchangeable software component that contains everything needed to provide a specific functionality.<sup>[1]</sup>  Depending on the context, the term *module* can have different meanings. We describe here some types of modules and suggest other documentation references.

## Precision

### Lmod Modules

Also called *environment modules*, Lmod modules are used to modify your environment (shell) to allow the use of a software package or a version of software other than the one offered by default, for example for compilers (see [Using Modules](Using Modules)).


### Python Modules

A Python module is a file usually consisting of Python code that can be loaded with the statements `import ...` or `from ... import ...`. A Python package is a collection of Python modules; note that the terms *package* and *module* are often used interchangeably.<sup>[2]</sup>

Some Python modules such as Numpy can be imported if you first load the Lmod module `scipy-stack` at the shell level (see [Software Stack SpiCy](Software Stack SpiCy)).

We offer a large collection of Python wheels, which are pre-compiled modules compatible with our standard software environments.

Before importing modules from a wheel, you must create a virtual environment.

Python modules that are neither in the Lmod module `scipy-stack` nor in our collection of wheels can be installed from the internet as described in [Installing Packages](Installing Packages).
