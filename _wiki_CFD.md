## OpenFOAM

A suite of open-source solvers and tools for CFD. Multiple versions of OpenFOAM are available as modules on our clusters.


## Fluent

This is a commercial CFD program that is part of the Ansys package, available on our clusters, though the user is required to supply a license.


## WRF

A non-commercial program for atmospheric fluid dynamics. WRF is available as a module on our clusters.


## Lattice Boltzmann techniques

(available later)


## Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics
