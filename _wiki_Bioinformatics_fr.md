## General Information

Bioinformatics is the application of computational methods in biological and biomedical research, often involving large-scale data generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS), proteomics, metabolomics, and other high-throughput experimental technologies. Common workflows on high-performance computing systems include genome and transcriptome assembly, variant calling, gene expression quantification, epigenomic profiling, and multi-omics integration.

While bioinformatics overlaps with fields like computational biology and systems biology, its use of specialized tools with vast datasets makes it particularly well-suited to high-performance computing environments. The Alliance supports a wide range of bioinformatics applications and workflows through pre-installed modules, containerized environments, and workflow management systems.

A dedicated national bioinformatics team is available to assist you with tool selection and pipeline development and optimization. For a detailed list of supported software, see the list below.


## Available Software

See the list of modules available on our clusters. Click on the column header *Type*; the type *bio* identifies bioinformatics applications.

Many software packages can be installed via Conda.  We do not directly support the use of Conda on our systems for reasons explained on the [Anaconda](link-to-anaconda-page) page.

However, you can create a Conda environment within an Apptainer container; see [Working with Conda](link-to-conda-page) for details.

Several of these software packages are available as Python packages. Packages adapted to our systems are found on our [Python Wheels page](link-to-python-wheels-page).

You will find other packages on the internet. For more information, see our [Python page](link-to-python-page).


## Data

Several databases are available on our clusters, including the NCBI non-redundant BLAST database, the AlphaFold protein structure database, and the Kraken2 standard database: see the directory `/cvmfs/bio.data.computecanada.ca`.

For other databases and datasets, see:

* `/cvmfs/ref.mugqic` (supported by C3G, see below)
* `/cvmfs/ref.galaxy`
* `/cvmfs/public.data.computecanada.ca`
* `/datashare` Graham Reference Dataset Repository, [external documentation](link-to-external-documentation)

Please note that not all datasets are available on all of our clusters and technical support may vary depending on the system. However, we will attempt to assist you whenever possible.


## External Support Resource

Affiliated with McGill University, the Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics (C3G) collaborates with the Alliance to provide tailored bioinformatics services and supports the research community as a member of the Alliance's national bioinformatics team.

C3G maintains two CVMFS repositories:

* `soft.mugqic`: which contains many open-source bioinformatics tools installed as modules.
* `ref.mugqic`: which contains reference genomes, their indices, and annotations for many common model organisms.

For any requests or questions regarding the `mugqic` repositories, contact C3G at [1](link-to-c3g-contact) or via their website [computationalgenomics.ca](link-to-c3g-website).
