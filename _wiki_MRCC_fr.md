## Introduction

MRCC is a suite of *ab initio* and density functional quantum chemistry programs for high-accuracy electronic structure calculations developed and maintained by the Quantum Chemistry Research Group of the Department of Physical Chemistry and Materials Science at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.  A distinctive feature is the use of automated programming tools. MRCC has enabled the development of tensor manipulation routines independent of the number of indices of the corresponding tensors, thus considerably simplifying the general implementation of quantum chemical methods. By applying the automated tools, several quantum chemical models and techniques of high complexity have been implemented so far, including arbitrary coupled cluster (CC) and single-reference configuration interaction (CI) methods, multi-reference CC approaches, CC and CI derivative energies, and arbitrary response and perturbation CC approaches.


## License Limitations
