## Description

Git is a fast and secure distributed tool for source code management (website, [gitscm.org](gitscm.org)). The application was created for the Linux project by Linus Torvalds and is maintained by Junio Hamano. Git development takes place on the [kernel.org](kernel.org) platform.


## Operating Principle

Unlike older source code management tools, Git works in a decentralized mode, and developers do not depend on a central repository to archive modifications. Each Git repository contains the complete working tree history. Each Git object (modification or changeset, file, directory) is a leaf of a multi-branch tree. Project development with Git is based on a model where a branch corresponds to a feature. Several iterations of the feature can be archived before it is merged with the common trunk. For details on the branching development model, see [A successful Git branching model](A successful Git branching model).

A particularly interesting technique is cherry-picking, which consists of taking part of a branch to merge it with another.


## Usage

As a general rule, a developer should be able to:

* Clone or create the repository;
* Make the modifications;
* Commit the modifications;
* Propagate the modifications to the original repository.

Since Git is decentralized, there is not necessarily an authoritative repository.

## Creating or Cloning a Repository

The first step is usually to create your own repository or clone an existing one.

To create a repository:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ git init my-project
```

To clone a repository:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ git clone git://github.com/git/git.git
```


## Committing and Saving a Modification

When the repository is ready, change directories and edit the file.

```bash
[name@server ~]$ cd my-project
[name@server ~]$ nano file.txt
```

When the work is finished, add the file:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ git add file.txt
```

and commit the modification:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ git commit
```

It is now possible to propagate the modifications to the original repository with:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ git push origin main
```

In this last command, `origin` is the remote repository and `main` is the current branch that will be propagated.  With older Git repositories, you may need to use `git push origin master`.


## Git Repository Hosting

GitHub and Bitbucket are the two main Git hosting services. They are both available for commercial projects and free projects.
