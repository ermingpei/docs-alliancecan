Béluga is a heterogeneous and versatile cluster designed for general-purpose computing. It is located at the École de technologie supérieure.  Its name is a reference to the beluga whale, a marine mammal inhabiting the waters of the St. Lawrence River.


## Particularities

Our policy dictates that Béluga compute nodes do not have internet access.  For exceptions, contact technical support explaining your needs and justification. Note that the `crontab` tool is not available.

Each task should last at least one hour (at least five minutes for test tasks), and a user cannot have more than 1000 tasks (running and pending) at a time. The maximum duration of a task is 7 days (168 hours).


## Storage

### HOME

*   Lustre file system, 105 TB of total space
*   This space is small and cannot be expanded: you will need to use your `project` space for large storage needs.
*   Small, fixed quotas per user
*   Automatic backup once a day.

### SCRATCH

*   Lustre file system, 2.6 PB of total space
*   Large space for storing temporary files during calculations.
*   No automatic backup system.
*   Large, fixed quotas per user
*   Automatic purge of old files from this space.

### PROJECT

*   Lustre file system, 25 PB of total space
*   This space is designed for data sharing between group members and for storing large amounts of data.
*   Large, adjustable quotas per project
*   Automatic backup once a day.

For Globus data transfers, use the endpoint `computecanada#beluga-dtn`. For tools like rsync and scp, a login node can be used.


## High-Performance Networking

The Mellanox Infiniband EDR (100 Gb/s) network connects all cluster nodes. A central 324-port switch aggregates connections from the islands with a maximum blocking factor of 5:1. Storage servers are connected with a non-blocking interconnect. The architecture allows for multiple parallel tasks with up to 640 cores (or more) thanks to non-blocking networking. For larger tasks, the blocking factor is 5:1; even for tasks running on multiple islands, the interconnect is high-performance.


## Node Characteristics

Turbo mode is now enabled on all Béluga nodes.

To obtain a larger `$SLURM_TMPDIR` space, request `--tmp=xG`, where `x` is a value between 350 and 2490.


## Task Monitoring

From the [portal](https://portail.beluga.calculquebec.ca/), you can monitor your CPU and GPU computation tasks in "real-time" or past tasks to maximize resource utilization and reduce queue wait times.

You can visualize, for a given task:

*   CPU core usage
*   Memory used
*   GPU usage

It is important to use the allocated resources and adjust your requests when computing resources are underutilized or not used at all. For example, if you request four cores (CPUs) but only use one, you should adjust your submission file accordingly.
