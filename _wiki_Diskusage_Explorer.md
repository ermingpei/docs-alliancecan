# Diskusage Explorer

Other languages: English, français

## Content of folders

**Warning:** This tool is currently only available on Béluga and Narval.

You can get a breakdown by folder of how the disk space is being consumed in your `/home`, `/scratch`, and `/project` spaces. That information is currently updated once a day and is stored in an SQLite format for fast access.

Here is how to explore your disk consumption, using the example of `/project` space `def-professor` as the particular directory to investigate.

### ncurse user interface

Choose a `/project` space you have access to and want to analyze; for the purpose of this discussion we will use `def-professor`.

```bash
[name@server ~]$ diskusage_explorer /project/def-professor
```

This command loads a browser that shows the resources consumed by all files under any directory tree.

**Navigating your project space with duc's ncurse tool**

Type `c` to toggle between consumed disk space and the number of files, `q` or `<esc>` to quit, and `h` for help.

If you are only interested in a subdirectory of this `/project` space and do not want to navigate the whole tree in the ncurse user interface, use:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ diskusage_explorer /project/def-professor/subdirectory/
```

A complete manual page is available with the `man duc` command.

### Graphical user interface

**Note:** When the login node is especially busy or if you have an especially large number of files in your `/project` space, the graphical interface mode can be slow and choppy. For a better experience, you can read the section below to run `diskusage_explorer` on your own machine.

Note that we recommend the use of the standard text-based ncurse mode on our cluster login nodes, but `diskusage_explorer` also includes a nice graphical user interface (GUI).

First, make sure that you are connected to the cluster in such a way that SSH is capable of correctly displaying GUI applications. You can then use a graphical interface by means of the command:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ duc gui -d /project/.duc_databases/def-professor.sqlite /project/def-professor
```

You can navigate the folders with the mouse and still type `c` to toggle between the size of the files and the number of files.

### Browse faster on your own machine

First, install the `diskusage_explorer` software on your local machine and then, still on your local machine, download the SQLite file from your cluster and run `duc`.

```bash
rsync -v --progress username@beluga.calculcanada.ca:/project/.duc_databases/def-professor.sqlite  .
duc gui -d ./def-professor.sqlite  /project/def-professor
```

This immediately leads to a smoother and more satisfying browsing experience.

## Space and file count usage per user on Cedar

On Cedar, it is possible for any member of a group to run `diskusage_report` with the following options `--per_user` and `--all_users` to have the breakdown per user. The first option displays only heavy users. In other terms, members of the group who have more files and/or occupy more space. When both options are used, the command gives the breakdown for all members of the group. This is a handy command that helps to identify the users within a group who have more files and/or a large amount of data and ask them to better manage their data by reducing their file count usage, for example.

In the following example, user `user01` runs the command and gets the following output:

```bash
[user01@cedar1 ~]$ diskusage_report --per_user --all_users
```

**Description** | **Space** | **# of files**
------- | -------- | --------
`/home` (`user` `user01`) | 109k/50G | 12/500k
`/scratch` (`user` `user01`) | 4000/20T | 1/1000k
`/project` (`group` `user01`) | 0/2048k | 0/1025
`/project` (`group` `def-professor`) | 9434G/10T | 497k/500k

**Breakdown for nearline def-professor (Last update: 2023-05-02 01:01:30)**

**User** | **File count** | **Size** | **Location**
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
user03 | 5 | 1197.90 GiB | On disk and tape
**Total** | **5** | **1197.90 GiB** | **On disk and tape**

This group has 8 users and the above output shows clearly that at least 4 of them have a large number of files for a small amount of data:

**User** | **File count** | **Size** | **Location**
------- | -------- | -------- | --------
user01 | 28313 | 4.00 GiB | On disk
user02 | 11926 | 3.74 GiB | On disk

user06 | 201099 | 60.51 GiB | On disk
