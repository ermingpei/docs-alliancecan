# Storage and File Management

## Overview

We provide a wide range of storage options to meet the diverse needs of our users.  These solutions range from high-speed temporary local storage to various kinds of long-term storage, allowing you to choose the best medium for your needs and usage patterns.

In most cases, the filesystems on our systems are a shared resource and should be used responsibly.  Unwise behavior can negatively affect many other users. These filesystems are designed to store a limited number of very large files, typically binary, as very large text files (hundreds of MB or more) become less readable.  Avoid storing tens of thousands of small files (less than a few megabytes), especially in the same directory.  Use commands like `tar` or `zip` to archive many small files into a single large archive.

You are responsible for managing the age of your stored data. Most filesystems are not intended for indefinite archiving. When a file or directory is no longer needed, move it to a more appropriate filesystem (e.g., your personal workstation or another storage system under your control).  Use Globus for moving significant amounts of data between your workstation and our systems or between two of our systems.

Our storage systems are not for personal use and should only be used for research data.

When your account is created on a cluster, your home directory will contain symbolic links to your scratch and project spaces. These links provide easy access to other filesystems from your home directory and may appear up to a few hours after your first connection.  While your home and scratch spaces are unique to you, the project space is shared by a research group (individuals sponsored by a faculty member or members of an RAC allocation). You may have access to several project spaces, with symbolic links in the `projects` directory of your home directory. Every account has one or more projects.  In the `projects` folder, each user has a link to each project they can access. For users with a single active sponsored role, it's the default project of their sponsor. Users with more than one active sponsored role will have a default project corresponding to the faculty member with the most sponsored accounts.


All users can check available disk space and utilization for project, home, and scratch filesystems using the `diskusage_report` command-line utility:

```bash
# diskusage_report
                   Description                Space           # of files
                 Home (username)         280 kB/47 GB              25/500k
              Scratch (username)         4096 B/18 TB              1/1000k
       Project (def-username-ab)       4096 B/9536 GB              2/500k
          Project (def-username)       4096 B/9536 GB              2/500k
```

More detailed output is available using the Diskusage Explorer tool.


## Storage Types

Unlike personal computers, our systems typically have several storage spaces or filesystems. Use the right space for the right task.

**HOME:** Your home directory has a relatively small quota and doesn't perform well for large data read/write operations.  Use it for source code, small parameter files, and job submission scripts.

**PROJECT:** The project space has a significantly larger quota and is suitable for sharing data among a research group. Data should be fairly static; frequent changes (moving/renaming directories) burden the tape-based backup system.

**SCRATCH:** Use scratch for intensive read/write operations on large files (> 100 MB).  Important files must be copied off scratch because it's not backed up, and older files are purged. Use it for temporary files (checkpoint files, job output, easily recreatable data).  **Do not use SCRATCH for regular storage!** It's for transient files you can afford to lose.

**SLURM_TMPDIR:** While a job runs, the environment variable `$SLURM_TMPDIR` provides a unique path to a temporary folder on a fast, local filesystem on each compute node. The directory and its contents are deleted when the job ends. Use it for temporary files needed only during the job.  It offers increased performance due to its local nature and is well-suited for large collections of small files (e.g., smaller than a few megabytes per file). Note that this filesystem is shared between all jobs running on the node, and the available space depends on the compute node type.  More information on using `$SLURM_TMPDIR` is available at [this page](link_to_page_needed).


## Project Space Consumption Per User

`diskusage_report` shows per-user space and file count usage for home and scratch but shows the total group quota for project.  To estimate your space and file count usage on the entire project space, use:

```bash
lfs quota -u $USER /project
```

Estimate the number of files in a directory (and subdirectories) using:

```bash
lfs find <path to the directory> -type f | wc -l
```

## Best Practices

* Regularly clean up data in scratch and project spaces.
* Use text format only for files smaller than a few megabytes.
* Use scratch and local storage for temporary files (use `$SLURM_TMPDIR`).
* For in-file searching, read the entire file before searching (fastest).
* Archive and compress files no longer in use but needing retention; move them to an alternative location (e.g., nearline).
* See [Handling large collections of files](link_to_page_needed) for managing many files, especially if limited by file count quotas.
* Avoid parallel write access to shared filesystems (home, scratch, project) unless using specialized tools like MPI-IO.
* Contact technical support if your needs aren't met by available storage options.


## Filesystem Quotas and Policies

Quotas and policies ensure adequate space for all users, including backups and automatic purging.

By default, each user has access to home and scratch spaces, and each group has access to 1 TB of project space.  Small increases in project and scratch spaces are available through our Rapid Access Service (RAS). Larger increases in project spaces are available through the annual Resource Allocation Competition (RAC).  Use `diskusage_report` to see your current quota usage.

**(Several tables showing Filesystem Characteristics for different clusters are present here.  Due to their repetitive nature and slight variations, they are omitted from this Markdown output for brevity.  The information within these tables should be included in a structured format within the final Markdown file.)**

Starting April 1, 2024, new Rapid Access Service (RAS) policies will allow larger quotas for project and nearline spaces. For more details, see the "Storage" section at [Rapid Access Service](link_to_page_needed). Quota changes larger than those permitted by RAS will require an application to the annual [Resource Allocation Competition (RAC)](link_to_page_needed).


The backup policy on home and project space is nightly backups retained for 30 days; deleted files are retained for a further 60 days. This is distinct from the scratch space purging age limit. Contact technical support to recover previous file versions.
