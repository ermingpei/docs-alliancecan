# OpenACC Tutorial

Other languages: English, fran√ßais

This tutorial is strongly inspired by the OpenACC Bootcamp session presented at GPU Technology Conference 2016.

OpenACC is an application programming interface (API) for porting code onto accelerators such as GPUs and coprocessors. It was developed by Cray, CAPS, NVIDIA, and PGI.  Similar to OpenMP, the programmer annotates C, C++, or Fortran code to identify portions that should be parallelized by the compiler.

A self-paced course on this topic is available from SHARCNET: [Introduction to GPU Programming](link-to-course-here).


## Prerequisites for this Tutorial

This tutorial uses OpenACC to accelerate C, C++, or Fortran code. A working knowledge of one of these languages is required to benefit fully.


## Getting Ready

This tutorial is based on examples. You can download all the examples from this [GitHub repository](link-to-github-repo-here).


## Lesson Plan

* Introduction
* Gathering a profile and getting compiler information
* Expressing parallelism with OpenACC directives
* Expressing data movement
* Optimizing loops
