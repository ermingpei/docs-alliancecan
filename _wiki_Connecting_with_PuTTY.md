## Start up PuTTY

and enter the host name or IP address of the machine you wish to connect to. You may also save a collection of settings by entering a session name in the *Save Sessions* text box and clicking the *Save* button. You can set the username to use when logging into a particular host under the *Connection->Data* section in the *Auto-login username* text box to save typing the username when connecting.

## X11 forwarding

If working with graphical-based programs, X11 forwarding should be enabled. To do this, go to *Connection->SSH->X11* and check the *Enable X11 forwarding* checkbox. To use X11 forwarding one must install an X window server such as Xming or, for recent versions of Windows, VcXsrv. The X window server should be actually started prior to connecting with SSH. Test that X11 forwarding is working by opening a PuTTY session and running a simple GUI-based program, such as typing the command `xclock`. If you see a popup window with a clock, X11 forwarding should be working.

## Using a key pair

To set the private key PuTTY uses when connecting to a machine, go to *Connection->SSH->Auth* and click the *Browse* button to find the private key file to use. PuTTY uses files with a `.ppk` suffix, which are generated using PuTTYGen (see [Generating SSH keys in Windows](Generating SSH keys in Windows) for instructions on how to create such a key). In newer versions of PuTTY, you need to click the "+" sign next to *Auth* and then select *Credentials* to be able to browse for the *Private key file for authentication*. Note that the additional fields in that newer interface, i.e., *Certificate to use* and *Plugin to provide authentication response*, should be left blank.
