# Arbutus Object Storage Clients

For information on obtaining Arbutus Object Storage, please see [this page](link-to-obtaining-arbutus-object-storage).  For information on how to use an object storage client to manage your Arbutus object store, choose a client and follow instructions from these pages:

* [Accessing object storage with s3cmd](link-to-s3cmd-instructions)
* [Accessing object storage with WinSCP](link-to-winscp-instructions)
* [Accessing the Arbutus object storage with AWS CLI](link-to-aws-cli-instructions)
* [Accessing the Arbutus object storage with Globus](link-to-globus-instructions)

It is important to note that Arbutus' Object Storage solution does not use Amazon's S3 Virtual Hosting (i.e. DNS-based bucket) approach which these clients assume by default. They need to be configured not to use that approach, as described in the pages linked above.


**Note:**  Replace the bracketed placeholders (`link-to-obtaining-arbutus-object-storage`, `link-to-s3cmd-instructions`, `link-to-winscp-instructions`, `link-to-aws-cli-instructions`, `link-to-globus-instructions`) with the actual URLs.
