# Biomolecular Simulation

## General Information

Biomolecular simulation [1] is the application of molecular dynamics simulation to biochemical research.  Processes that can be modeled include protein folding, drug binding, membrane transport, and conformational changes essential to protein function.

Biomolecular simulation is considered a sub-domain of computational chemistry; however, its scope is specialized enough that we have a dedicated team of experts.  See also the list of resources available in computational chemistry.


## Software

The following software packages are available through our resources:

* AMBER
* GROMACS
* NAMD
* DL_POLY
* HOOMD-blue
* LAMMPS
* OpenKIM (Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models)
* OpenMM
* PLUMED, a code library for the development of free energy calculations in molecular dynamics simulations (see also GROMACS)
* Rosetta
* DSSP
* VMD


### Python Wheels

Calcul Canada offers Python wheels that can be installed in Python virtual environments; these wheels are very useful in biomolecular and molecular dynamics simulation.

The following list contains a selection of the most useful wheels, but should not be considered exhaustive:

* **ACPYPE:** AnteChamber PYthon Parser interfacE, a tool for generating topologies of chemical compounds.
* **MDAnalysis**, an object-oriented Python library for the analysis of trajectories in molecular dynamics simulations in several formats.
* **MDTraj**, which can also read, write, and analyze trajectories with a few lines of Python code, in a wide variety of formats.
* **Biopython**, a set of free tools for biological calculations.
* **foyer**, a package to determine atom types and apply and disseminate force fields.
* **mBuild**, a hierarchical language for building molecules based on components.
* **mdsynthesis**, a set of tools for manipulating and analyzing molecular dynamics data.
* **nglview**, a collection of online tools for molecular visualization.
* **ParmEd**, a general tool for analyzing biomolecular systems with popular simulation packages.
* **PyRETIS**, a Python library for rare event simulations, with an emphasis on transition interface sampling and transition interface sampling with replica exchange.

See the list of available wheels and the `avail_wheels` command to find out what is available.

If you need other Python packages or newer versions, contact technical support.


## Training

Training workshops are given by our national team for molecular modeling and simulation; dates will be announced in advance.

You can also consult the training materials via the following links:

* Practical considerations for Molecular Dynamics
* Visualizing Structures with VMD
* Running Molecular Dynamics with Amber on our clusters
* Analyzing Molecular Dynamics Data with PYTRAJ


## Performance and Benchmarking

The Molecular Dynamics Performance Guide was created by an ACENET team. The guide describes the optimal conditions for running tasks on our clusters with AMBER, GROMACS, NAMD, and OpenMM.
