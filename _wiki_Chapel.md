# Chapel

**Other languages:** English, franÃ§ais

Chapel is a general-purpose, compiled, high-level parallel programming language with built-in abstractions for shared- and distributed-memory parallelism. There are two styles of parallel programming in Chapel:

1.  **Task parallelism**, where parallelism is driven by programmer-specified tasks.
2.  **Data parallelism**, where parallelism is driven by applying the same computation on subsets of data elements, which may be in the shared memory of a single node, or distributed over multiple nodes.

These high-level abstractions make Chapel ideal for learning parallel programming for a novice HPC user. Chapel is incredibly intuitive, striving to merge the ease-of-use of Python and the performance of traditional compiled languages such as C and Fortran. Parallel blocks that typically take tens of lines of MPI code can be expressed in only a few lines of Chapel code. Chapel is open source and can run on any Unix-like operating system, with hardware support from laptops to large HPC systems.

Chapel has a relatively small user base, so many libraries that exist for C, C++, Fortran have not yet been implemented in Chapel. Hopefully, that will change in coming years if Chapel adoption continues to gain momentum in the HPC community.

## Single-locale Chapel

Single-locale (single node; shared-memory only) Chapel on our general-purpose clusters is provided by the module `chapel-multicore`. You can use `salloc` to test Chapel codes either in serial:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ module load gcc/12.3 chapel-multicore/2.3.0
[name@server ~]$ salloc --time=0:30:0 --ntasks=1 --mem-per-cpu=3600 --account=def-someprof
[name@server ~]$ chpl test.chpl -o test
[name@server ~]$ ./test
```

or on multiple cores on the same node:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ module load gcc/12.3 chapel-multicore/2.3.0
[name@server ~]$ salloc --time=0:30:0 --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=3 --mem-per-cpu=3600 --account=def-someprof
[name@server ~]$ chpl test.chpl -o test
[name@server ~]$ ./test
```

For production jobs, please write a job submission script and submit it with `sbatch`.


## Multi-locale Chapel

Multi-locale (multiple nodes; hybrid shared- and distributed-memory) Chapel on our InfiniBand clusters is provided by the module `chapel-ucx`.

Consider the following Chapel code printing basic information about the nodes available inside your job:

**File: `probeLocales.chpl`**

```chapel
use MemDiagnostics;

for loc in Locales do on loc {
  writeln("locale #", here.id, "...");
  writeln("  ...is named: ", here.name);
  writeln("  ...has ", here.numPUs(), " processor cores");
  writeln("  ...has ", here.physicalMemory(unit=MemUnits.GB, retType=real), " GB of memory");
  writeln("  ...has ", here.maxTaskPar, " maximum parallelism");
}
```

To run this code on an InfiniBand cluster, you need to load the `chapel-ucx` module:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ module load gcc/12.3 chapel-ucx/2.3.0
[name@server ~]$ salloc --time=0:30:0 --nodes=4 --cpus-per-task=3 --mem-per-cpu=3500 --account=def-someprof
```

Once the interactive job starts, you can compile and run your code from the prompt on the first allocated compute node:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ chpl --fast probeLocales.chpl
[name@server ~]$ ./probeLocales -nl 4
```

For production jobs, please write a Slurm submission script and submit your job with `sbatch` instead.


## Multi-locale Chapel with NVIDIA GPU support

To enable GPU support, please use the module `chapel-ucx-cuda`. It adds NVIDIA GPU support to multi-locale Chapel on our InfiniBand clusters.

Consider the following basic Chapel GPU code:

**File: `probeGPU.chpl`**

```chapel
use GpuDiagnostics;

startGpuDiagnostics();
writeln("Locales: ", Locales);
writeln("Current locale: ", here, " named ", here.name, " with ", here.maxTaskPar, " CPU cores", " and ", here.gpus.size, " GPUs");

// same code can run on GPU or CPU
var operateOn = if here.gpus.size > 0 then here.gpus[0] // use the first GPU
                 else here; // use the CPU
writeln("operateOn: ", operateOn);

on operateOn {
  var A: [1..10] int;
  @assertOnGpu
  foreach a in A do // thread parallelism on a CPU or a GPU
    a += 1;
  writeln(A);
}

stopGpuDiagnostics();
writeln(getGpuDiagnostics());
```

To run this code on an InfiniBand cluster, you need to load the `chapel-ucx-cuda` module:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ module load gcc/12.3 cuda/12.2 chapel-ucx-cuda/2.3.0
[name@server ~]$ salloc --time=0:30:0 --mem-per-cpu=3500 --gpus-per-node=1 --account=def-someprof
```

Once the interactive job starts, you can compile and run your code from the prompt on the allocated compute node:

```bash
[name@server ~]$ chpl --fast probeGPU.chpl
[name@server ~]$ ./probeGPU -nl 1
```

For production jobs, please write a Slurm submission script and submit your job with `sbatch` instead.
