# Build Tools

These are tools for managing and, to the extent possible, automating the build process.  This process involves compiling and linking a collection of source code files and libraries to create an executable file.  Build tools also handle various platform-specific configuration issues.

Linux offers a variety of build tools; Compute Canada systems include the most common:

*   **Make**
*   **Autotools**
*   **CMake**
